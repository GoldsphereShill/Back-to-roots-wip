Curent:
- Mechanics sell very little stuff
- Universal Armor Repair kit cannot repair light outfits for some reason.
- Removal of grooming kit and swiss knife will require a lot of crafting recipies to be changed

Solved:
- The niS thing persists even after turning off debugMode /// FIXED
- Sewing Kits arent properly merged (remnants of the old system exist in ph_box_items_by_levels.ltx, items_repair.ltx, ph_box_items_count.ltx, trade_generic_mechanic.ltx, st_items_repair.xml /// FIXED
- Universal Repair Kit repairs only medium armours, NOT ONLY A LOCALIZATION ISSUE. This is caused by non existing items being listed in the item_repair.ltx /// Partially FIXED
