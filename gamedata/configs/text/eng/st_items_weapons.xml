Together with that pistol, .45 ACP served in US military for almost 100 years before being replaced by 9x19mm Parabellum. .45 ACP is an effective handgun cartridge that is accurate, has good terminal ballistics and produces moderate recoil in handguns. Thanks to it's subsonic velocity it is a great round for use in suppressed weapons (since it doesn't produce sonic boom). However, it's also a drawback, as because of it's weight and low muzzle velocity, the .45 ACP exhibits noticeable bullet drop on range. While it's not an issue with pistols, which are usually meant to be used on ranges shorter than 30 meters, it's becoming a problem when using submachine guns or pistol-caliber carbines. When shooting targets beyond 50 meters, one should remember that the bullets will start to drop, and adjusting sights or aiming above the target might be needed.  It's disadvantages in comparison to 9x19mm Parabellum are higher recoil, much heavier weight and bigger size, which reduces the amount of ammunition that can be fit into pistol's magazine (for example USP magazine fits 16 rounds of 9x19mm and 12 rounds of .45 ACP). It also has worse penetration capabilities than 9x19mm Para. Nonetheless, it's still a good and capable cartridge and the choice between 9x19mm Para and .45 ACP mostly comes down to personal preferences.

It was developed for PTRS and PTRD anti-tank rifles in order to provide infantry with (relatively) light anti-tank assets. Before these anti-tank rifles were developed, Soviet infantry had to rely on anti tank guns or use anti tank grenades to destroy enemy armored vehicles, which was often a suicide, especially in open areas of Russian never-ending steppes. 14.5x114mm cartridge could penetrate up to 40mm of rolled homogenous armor on 100 meters distance - an incredible value in these times, as comparable AT rifles of the time had penetration values of about 25mm. Such power came at cost, as the recoil generated by this cartridge is immense, and can even dislocate the shoulder if not handled properly. Later it was used in KPV machine guns in anti-aircraft role thanks to it's very good range and is used as main armament of BTR-80 infantry vehicle. Today it still remains useful, as it has been used in Syria and Ukrainian Civil War as a weapon against light vehicles and as anti-materiel rifle as it could kill enemies, especially snipers, who hid behind walls. In The Zone it is often used, rarer for above reasons and more as a weapon against big mutants like Pseudogiants, especially on outposts of Duty or other factions who keep their presence in deep parts of The Zone, since it's powerful incendiary bullet tears their internal organs to shreds and causes heavy bleeding, killing the beasts in just few shots. \n \n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Penetration rating: %c[0,51,255,102]10+/10\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Stopped by body armor class: %c[0,51,255,102]none\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Tissue damage rating: %c[0,170,170,170]10+/10\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Tissue damage multiplier: %c[0,51,255,102]140% %c[0,140,140,140](multiplies the value from weapon's statistic by given percent)</text>

It is not without a cost - the recoil is absolutely immense, and untrained shooters might not be able to withstand it. It is almost impossible to effectively fire it rapidly. It's power however allows to bring down most mutants in The Zone reliably, without need to hit them multiple times. It's huge size and heavy weight however makes it less popular as a hunting tool, with mutant hunters preferring battle rifles loaded with Soft Point bullets, and smaller Magnum handguns as sidearms. \n \n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Penetration rating: %c[0,170,170,170]4.5/10\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Stopped by body armor class: %c[0,170,170,170]III\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Tissue damage rating: %c[0,170,170,170]8-9/10\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Tissue damage multiplier: %c[0,51,255,102]150% %c[0,140,140,140](multiplies the value from weapon's statistic by given percent</text>

It was developed in 1960s when first AR-15 rifle (later standarised as M16) came out and quickly shown it's huge potential, despite conservative decision makers' opposition. It became the standard cartridge for NATO forces as well as many non-NATO countries. It is less powerful than full-size 7.62x51mm cartridge, but also weights less, has flatter trajectory and has way lower recoil, improving rapid-firing accuracy. Despite it's small dimensions it has pretty good terminal ballistics as it's prone to yaw and fragment in soft tissue, causing way higher damage than its' caliber would suggest. However, it's yawing potential is dependant on velocity (and therefore the lenght of the barrel, since the longer the barrel the higher the velocity) and it loses a lot of power when shot from short-barreled platform. Despite this issue, 5.56x45mm is an all-around effective cartridge that is available in multiple types which you can choose depending on your needs. It is well liked by Stalkers and is readily available on the market as one of the few western types of ammunition. Mk262 is an american Open Tip Match cartridge that was first used as ammunition for marksman rifles, but thanks to it's greatly improved terminal ballistics it started to become used by Special Forces in M4A1 and Mk18 carbines for higher effectiveness. For these reasons it also become favourite ammo for some Mercenaries groups, and some batches can also be bought on black market in The Zone.\n \n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Penetration rating: %c[0,170,170,170]4/10\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Stopped by body armor class: %c[0,170,170,170]III\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Tissue damage rating: %c[0,170,170,170]6-6.5/10\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Tissue damage multiplier: %c[0,51,255,102]163% %c[0,140,140,140](multiplies the value from weapon's statistic by given percent)\n \n%c[0,170,170,170]SPECIAL:\n \n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Accurized cartridge for highest possible precision.

Unlike 5.56x45mm it provides good terminal ballistics even when shot from short barrels and has great performance when used as subsonic cartridge in suppressed carbines (providing ballistics comparable to 9x39mm rounds). Out of longer barrels it has similar accuracy and bullet drop as 5.56x45mm round, but it keeps higher energy on high distance. It can be loaded to standard 5.56 AR-15 magazines without loss in capacity and shot without problems. It's advantage over 5.56x45mm NATO are better terminal ballistics, especially when shooting subsonic loads, while feeding in AR-15 without problems - AR-15s that were adapted for comparable 7.62x39mm rounds were often jamming. Disadvantages are heavier weight and lower muzzle velocity. .300 Blackout is currently sometimes used by special forces and well regarded among hunters as a reliable and effective load for medium game. In Zone it is well liked for the same reasons, providing better wounding capabilities than 5.56 and 5.45 caliber weapons, all that while reliably loading from AR-15 type weapons. It's high price and low availability can be a problem for some Stalkers, who may prefer cheaper rifles in more popular calibers.\n \n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Penetration rating: %c[0,170,170,170]10/10\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Stopped by body armor class: %c[0,170,170,170]V\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Tissue damage rating: %c[0,170,170,170]2.5/10\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Tissue damage multiplier: %c[0,204,0,51]52% %c[0,140,140,140](multiplies the value from weapon's statistic by given percent)</text>

Less effective vs unarmored enemies and mutants \n \n 7N25 is an armor piercing round designed in 2000s in Russia for use against enemies in body armor. The 9x18mm Makarov is a Russian handgun cartridge designed in 1946, and in 1951 it became a standard military pistol cartridge of the Soviet Union and the Eastern Bloc, analogous to the 9x19mm Parabellum in NATO and Western military use. It has slightly lower power than 9mm Parabellum, but is still an effective pistol cartridge. The reason for it's low power is because the Soviets wanted a compact, simple blowback action pistol - this type of construction can't handle more powerful ammunition, and 9x18mm is the most powerful round that can be used in such design without problems. Overally, 9x18mm is about 30% weaker than 9x19mm Parabellum. It's very good in small, compact pistols like PM, but loses out to 9x19mm when it comes to full-size military pistols, and in the end was replaced by 9x19mm Parabellum in Russian army. 9x18mm remains in service with Ukrainian military. It is widely available in The Zone, large amounts were stolen from the military warehouses or bought off from corrupt military officers. It's high availability and low price make it a great choice for many Stalkers. \n \n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Penetration rating: %c[0,170,170,170]4.5-5/10\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Stopped by body armor class: %c[0,170,170,170]IIIA\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Tissue damage rating: %c[0,170,170,170]2/10\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Tissue damage multiplier: %c[0,204,0,51]83% %c[0,140,140,140] (multiplies the value from weapon's statistic by given percent)</text>

In The Zone it's a well regarded and respected round, as for Loners main enemies are mutants - and to bring them down, high firepower is mandatory. 10mm pistols are well liked and preferred over Magnum revolvers, but ammo itself is relatively expensive and harder to find - it is however regarded to be worth the hassle.\n \n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Penetration rating: %c[0,170,170,170]3.5-4/10\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Stopped by body armor class: %c[0,170,170,170]IIIA\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Tissue damage rating: %c[0,170,170,170]4.5-5/10\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Tissue damage multiplier: %c[0,51,255,102]183% %c[0,170,170,170] (multiplies the value from weapon's statistic by given percent)</text>

Wide variety of .22LR ammo is available, with most popular being Soft Point High Velocity round, which is used as sporting and vermin-hunting cartridge. It has been brought to The Zone as a tool to kill rats and Tushkanos with greater efficiency, and is quite popular among those who want to hunt them, some Stalkers also like to hunt crows, and shooting them with .22LR is a big challenge - those who can reliably bring down a bird with one of .22LR pistols are respected as great marksmen. .22LR Soft Point bullet can penetrate human body and deforms efficiently in tissue, but it can have trouble penetrating thick clothes. Since almost everybody in The Zone wear light body armor or at least heavy jackets, .22LR has no place in combat. \n \n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Penetration rating: %c[0,170,170,170]0.5/10\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Stopped by body armor class: %c[0,170,170,170]I\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Tissue damage rating: %c[0,170,170,170]1.5/10\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Tissue damage multiplier: %c[0,51,255,102]150% %c[0,170,170,170] (multiplies the value from weapon's statistic by given percent)</text>

It is one of the lightest most durable, accurate, and high performance 5.56mm suppressors on the market. The Recce 5, weighs only 14.5 ounces on it's own and a mere 16.3 ounces as a suppressor system with the included Taper Mount Minimalist Brake. The included Taper Mount ensures minimal and repeatable point of impact shift with only minor weight gain. The Recce 5 achieves out of this world sound performance vs its size. Utilizing our Patented Efficiency baffle technology this compact suppressor drops SPL by 35db on a 14.5" M4 while keeping gas blow-back to normal levels. To increase performance for military users a high efficiency low profile flash suppressor was integrated into the front of the suppressor. This feature reduces flash, providing minimal signature for the user in low light environments. \n \n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Sound suppression: %c[0,170,170,170]high</text>

		<text>The RGM-40 Kastet (English: Brass knuckles) grenade launcher is a stand-alone version of the Russian GP-30 grenade launcher with a telescoping stock, AK-type pistol-grip and flip-up tangent sights. It is a single-shot muzzle loaded weapon with a self-cocking trigger mechanism and offers a high degree of commonality with the GP-30. It was developed mainly for police use with non-lethal grenades, but it is also popular among soldiers. Standalone grenade launchers are regaining popularity, as those mounted underbarrel are increasing weapon's weight and change balance too much, decreasing practical accuracy and making it uncomfortable to carry them for prolonged time.\n \n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] muzzle velocity: %c[0,170,170,170]~76 m / sec\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] fire range: %c[0,170,170,170]~300 m\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] reload time: %c[0,170,170,170]slow\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] ammunition: %c[0,170,170,170]VOG-25 40mm grenade</text>

KSVK is a bullpup configured, manually operated, rotary bolt (or straight-pull, depending on variant) rifle. Ammunition is fed from detachable 5-round box magazines. Heavy barrel is equipped with a massive muzzle brake. KSVK is fitted with standard Russian side-mounted scope rail, and can be fitted with variety of day and night scopes. Folding bipod is attached to a special extender, which runs below the barrel from the receiver, which allows for free floating barrel. Open iron sights on folding bases are installed for backup or emergency purposes. KSVK is said to be a moderately accurate rifle, similar to American Barret M82 rifle. It's advantages are very high power and range, but it is very heavy and unwieldy. KSVK is currently used only by Russian military. Some of these rifles came to The Zone with few of PMC teams, which can hint at least some of the Mercenaries groups in The Zone are linked to Russia's government.

It is a very unique weapon mechanically, using gas operated action with locked breech. The system greatly reduces felt recoil - shotguns often have very high recoil, but the AA-12 gas system absorbs great part of the recoil force, so the shooter doesn't feel the violent kick. The shotgun was made from stainless steel and the clearance is kept between the moving parts, which provides improved durability of parts and reliability of mechanism. AA-12 is only used by law enforcement agencies and the US Marines. Only test series were made, since the heavy automatic shotgun is overally quite a niche weapon. Few of these shotguns were carried by guards of UN scientific expedition that perished in deep parts of The Zone some time ago - after they were found, their weapons were sold on black market.

It took part in tests that were intended to unveil successor to AK-74 rifle, where AN-94 was deemed most succesful. However, later AN-94 was ditched and Russia again started to see potential in AEK-971. The biggest advantage AEK-971 has over AK-74 is the "Balanced Automatic Recoil System" (BARS), which uses special set of counterweights that greatly reduce felt recoil and muzzle climb of the weapon, making it extremely efficient when shooting even long bursts. It is considered one of the most advanced assault rifles at the moment, which has a reflection in it's price. The AEK-971 assault rifle was originally designed and tested during "Abakan" trials of late 1980s, where AN-94 won against it, and the AEK was shelved for some time. In 2013 a new version of AEK-971, the A-545, entered Ratnik trials alongside AK-12, where it shown great potential as it outperformed AK-12 on ranges up to 300 meters and in burst accuracy. The AEK-971's greatest advantage is so-called "balanced recoil system", which is a system of buffers which reduce felt recoil greatly by work of counterbalances. The synchronous and opposite movement of the balancing weight eliminates most recoil force except the recoil impulse, so the rifle becomes more stable during fully automatic fire. It's disadvantage however is greatly increased cost and slightly lowered reliability.\n \n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Reliability: %c[0,170,170,170]above average\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Durability: %c[0,170,170,170]high\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Ergonomics: %c[0,170,170,170]above average %c[0,140,140,140] \n \n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] ATTACHMENTS: 1P29 scope, GP-25 grenade launcher, 5.45 caliber compatible suppressor</text>

Moderate damage output. Best on medium range. %c[0,140,140,140]  \n \n%c[0,170,170,170]The wz.88 Tantal is a Polish 5.45x39mm assault rifle developed in the late 1980s and produced in famous weapons factory in Radom (FB Radom). It's basically an equivalent of Soviet AK-74 rifle with some minor differences, most notably the slightly higher rate of fire, three-round burst fire mode and folding stock mounted by standard. Use of new, smaller cartridge increases accuracy and range and makes it much easier to take follow up shots with it, which increases the chances of hitting - all this while retaining durability and reliability of other AK rifles. Tantal (Tantalum - Polish weapons and military equipment receive names of chemical elements) is widely considered to be an AK-74 variant, however it's base weapon was Polish modification of AKMS called wz.80 that has been rechambered to 5.45x39mm using AK-74 system as an example. Because of that, it has higher degree of parts interchangeability with AKM than AK-74 and is closer to it mechanically. Development of the new rifle chambered in 5.45mm caliber started officially in 1984 and by 1986 first prototypes were produced. The rifle was modernized and some faults were corrected(among the changes made, a series of components were introduced that were meant to be interchangeable with the AK-74, including the bolt carrier, bolt, magazines and the burst fire mode was further refined) and in 1989 the rifle entered mass production. It was well liked by soldiers and is considered by some to be even better than AK-74. Among it's downsides are heavier weight and less durable stock type, but it's a still a very reliable and accurate rifle. Mechanically it is just like AKM; it's a gas operated, selective fire weapon.

It has a folding stock, shorter barrel and redesigned handguard, which makes it more compact than standard AK variants, however, it's shorter sight radius lowers practical accuracy. AMD-65 was designed as a short AK variant, more handy to paratroopers and vehicle crews, who needed a weapon that provided good firepower but was easy to store in confined spaces. It sports a side folding stock of distinctive look and a shorter, 317mm (12.6") barrel, similar in lenght to that of the modern AK-105 rifle. Mechanically, the AMD-65 is just like AKM; it's a gas operated, selective fire weapon. The gas operated action has a massive bolt carrier with a permanently attached long stroke gas piston. The bolt carrier moves on the two rails with visible clearances between the parts, which allows the gun to operate even when it's interior is severely fouled with sand or mud. There are however a lot of changes to the weapon, not all of them good. It has special muzzle device that lowers the recoil considerably, but the redirection of gasses to the sides makes it deafeningly loud for the people standing beside the shooter. It doesn't have a wooden handguard and has a plastic front grip instead, which in theory should make it easier to control during fully automatic fire. Lack of wooden handguards helps with overheating, but also doesn't protect shooters' hand from hot barrel, which can cause accidental burns. It can use all types of AK magazines, but had special 20-round mags designed specially for use inside vehicles. AMD-65 was used in Hungarian army and was also exported to Middle East.

It uses a powerful 12.7x55mm ammunition (similar to the one of VSSK sniper rifle, but with different dimensions of bullet, so these two rounds are not interchangeable), which contains a heavy bullet that can penetrate even heaviest body armor, walls or metal plates and still deal significant tissue damage upon impact after penetration, maximizing chance of critical hit and disabling the enemy with the first shot. These rifles are employed only by Russian FSB in situations involving high risk to operators, where disabling the threat on the first hit is needed. Bringing down a human opponent requires either critical damage to nervous system or causing such a heavy blood loss that the subject passes out. To achieve this, ASh-12's ammunition, which already has high diameter, expands violently in tissue, causing severe damage to internal organs and extreme haemorrhaging - no other weapon of this type can match this kind of power. In tactical sense, the ASh-12 is an up-scaled version of AS Val - 9x39mm rifles were made with similar applications in mind (heavy, subsonic bullet with high penetration capabilities and good terminal ballistics). Mechanically  Some of these rifles came to The Zone from yet unknown source (rumors say some of Mercenaries groups are maintaining close cooperation with Russian government agencies) and have been used by mutant hunters squads, most notably Duty detachments.

However, due to it's less powerful cartridge and questionable reliability of helical magazine it never received as much appreciation as the former weapons. \n \n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Reliability: %c[0,170,170,170]above average\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Durability: %c[0,170,170,170]high\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Ergonomics: %c[0,170,170,170]above average %c[0,140,140,140] \n \n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] ATTACHMENTS: EKP-1S-03 Kobra red dot sight (permanent), 9mm-caliber compatible suppressor</text>

It is a blowback-operated, selective fire submachine gun which is based on the Israeli Uzi submachine gun. It fires from open bolt in standard configuration, but an alternative bolt system with separate firing pin can be installed for firing from closed bolt (for higher first-shot accuracy). Among it's features is unusual equipment for an SMG such as a bipod, 100-round magazine, frontal grip which can also act like spare magazine housing and an optics rail. Parts are made from stamped steel which was acid treated for improved resistance to rust and wear. The CBJ is relatively lightweight at 2.8kg, but compared to modern PDWs with polymer parts it is heavies of them all.

It was one of the first "wonder nines" - modern steel-frame pistols featuring double-stack magazine, a huge advantage over revolvers and older pistols, which usually had 7 or 8 rounds in single-stack magazine. Mechanically it's a short recoil operated, locked breech pistol using the Browning locking system. The slide and frame are made of steel, it has an SA/DA trigger and manual safety. High quality barrel is hammer forged. The CZ-75 became a great hit and is widely considered one of the best steel-frame pistols ever made. It's strong sides are good accuracy, crisp trigger, high reliability and an ability to carry it safely in condition 1 - "cocked and locked" (with a round in a chamber, the hammer cocked, safety engaged); which made it a good weapon for concealed carry. It's disadvantage is mostly relatively heavy weight and lower ergonomics that those of more modern polymer-frame pistols. Second-generation variant, the CZ-75B, had a redesigned trigger guard and upgraded internal parts, most notably the firing pin. High accuracy made it very popular as a pistol for competitive shooting and a lot of top shooters in Europe use CZ-75s customized for accuracy. From 1989 the CZ-75 is standard pistol of Czech military, it is also used by more than 20 countries' military and law enforcement forces. More than a million of these pistols were manufactured. CZ-75 is currently the most popular 9x19mm pistol in Central and Eastern Europe, together with Glock 17. Because of this, it is one of the most commonly seen handguns in The Zone, where it can be bought for cheap.

It was first designed for 9x19mm Parabellum, but then, due to political pressures from USSR, was redesigned for 7.62x25mm round, which was used back then as standard pistol ammunition in USSR and countries of communist bloc (known later as Warsaw Pact countries). Mechanically it's a roller-locked, short-recoil operated pistol of unusual construction - the roller-locking system is taken from the famous German MG-42 machine gun. The CZ-52 was specially designed to withstand powerful overpressure 7.62x25mm ammunition used in Czech submachine gun, most notably the Sa vz.26. This ammunition was more than 25% more powerful and could damage pistols designed for standard-pressure ammunition, that's why the roller system was used and the pistol itself was overbuilt. However, the slides and pins were not produced with high quality and they sometimes cracked when using these overpressure loads, so even thought it was reinforced, the low quality control made these pistols a failure in these terms, as it did not withstand pressures it was designed for. Nonetheless, the CZ-52 is working fine when using standard 7.62x25mm loads. It is heavy and rather awkward, but works reliably and can do it's job. About 200 000 of these pistols were produced for Czechoslovak military.

Currently the Duplets are increasingly less common as more weaponry is available for cheap from traders and arms smugglers. It is a simple, crude firearm made from reinforced scrap metal and wood, with two barrels placed horizontally. The accuracy is low due to crude finish of the inside of the barrel, but it's not an issue since the gun is made for point-blank ranges. Two barrels hold one shell each and can be fired both in the same time. Since the weapon is manually operated, it works relatively reliably - the only issue can be misfires, but nonetheless they don't happen as often as jams in semi-automatic improvised weapons (like Borz or homemade pistols). The spread is very wide. The weapon features a stock that is mounted with a spring, which slightly reduces felt recoil, but also lowers the stability. The durability is very low and as with every improvised firearm, adequate safety precautions should be retained, as there's always a risk of catastrophic failure, which can injure the shooter. These weapons are sold for cheap and are the last ditch protection for those who can't spare more for a real weapon.

It featured a simple blowback action. FN 1906 used very small cartridge, with dimensions of 6.35x18mm. While the .22LR is roughly as effective, it is very prone to misfires and jamming and as such the 6.35x18mm is much more effective load for defensive weapon. The bullet has weak terminal ballistics, but is also very small, just like the pistol itself - it can be hid in pocket of a shirt, and on a point-blank range it can be enough to kill. FN Baby and other pocket pistols were very popular in 1920s and 1930s as they could be purchased without license back then. Millions of pistols of this type were produced and lots of them are still hidden in basements or attics of houses all around Eastern Europe - some of them were brought by stalkers into The Zone. Some of them did this because they didn't have anything better and quickly got rid of them after buying or finding better weapon, but some stalkers also use it as a backup weapon - apart from a full-size handgun in a holster, they also keep these pistols in their pockets or ankle holsters, ready to use in dire situations.\n \n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Reliability: %c[0,170,170,170]average\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Durability: %c[0,170,170,170]above average\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Ergonomics: %c[0,170,170,170]average </text>

High penetration, but low damage output. %c[0,140,140,140]  \n \n%c[0,170,170,170]FN Five-seveN is a modern semi-automatic pistol designed and manufactured by FN in Belgium. It was developed specially for new 5.7x28mm FN cartridge, which was designed as a high-velocity round which has penetration capabilities of a rifle. The production started in 1998 and first users adopted it in the year 2000; in 2013 it became a service pistol of Belgian Army (modernized Mk2 version). It was adopted by multiple law enforcement and military organizations all around the world. It is a modern, polymer-framed pistol, even slide is polymer-encased to reduce weight. It has a striker-fired trigger and is using a delayed blowback action. The magazine holds 20 rounds. Despite it's very light weight the Five-seveN has very low recoil, which improves accuracy in rapid fire. It's advantages are high capacity, good controllability and weight, which is lower than all other polymer pistols. It's disadvantages are it's high price and unsatisfactory terminal ballistics when it comes to engaging unarmored targets - in such situations typical pistol rounds tend to be much more effective. The 5.7x28mm rounds however have very good penetration capabilities - FMJ rounds can penetrate bulletproof vests even up to level III and dedicated AP rounds will penetrate level IV body armor - something that 9x19mm rounds can not achieve. Whether it is worth to invest in Five-seveN and trade terminal ballistics for penetration is up to user. Some counter-terrorist forces use these pistols when dealing with attackers in body armor and some mercenary teams in The Zone tend to carry them since most stalkers wear multiple layers of thick protective clothing and standard rounds might have trouble with penetration. Still, these pistols remain expensive and rare and are not as universal as other weapons chambered in more typical calibers.\n \n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Reliability: %c[0,170,170,170]high\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Durability: %c[0,170,170,170]above average\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Ergonomics: %c[0,170,170,170]above average %c[0,140,140,140] \n \n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] ATTACHMENTS: 5.7mm caliber suppressor</text>

It used completely new gas system which got rid of some of AR-15's problems. Mechanically, AR-18 is a gas operated rifle using a short piston stroke, rotating bolt locking mechanism. The two-part receiver is made from stamped sheet steel, the furniture is made of black polymer. AR-18 has a side-folding stock mounted by default - one of AR-15's problems is that the long buffer tube doesn't allow for usage of folding stock. Barrel's length is 18.25", which gives the 5.56mm bullet high velocity, improving it's terminal performance, as it relies on velocity to yaw and fragment in the tissue. The AR-18 is overally a more rigid and reliable rifle than AR-15, better suited to continuous abuse in the field. While the AR-18 itself wasn't successful and only about 20 000 were produced (compared to dozens of millions of AR-15s), the AR-18 design was very influential and most modern rifles are based on it's design, for example the G36. A lot of AR-18s reached the black market, they were one of the most common weapons of Provisional IRA during The Troubles in Northern Ireland, some were also sold to third world countries. In The Zone some AR-18 came via black market connections too, where they are well liked for their high reliability and good accuracy. \n \n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Reliability: %c[0,170,170,170]high\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Durability: %c[0,170,170,170]above average\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Ergonomics: %c[0,170,170,170]above average %c[0,140,140,140] \n \n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] ATTACHMENTS: 5.56 caliber compatible suppressor</text>

It became the service rifle of Belgian army in 1989 and around that time also became adopted in multiple other countries, among them Indonesia, Libya and Venezuela. Sweden adopted the FNC in modified configuration, designed for harsh subarctic conditions, and produced them locally on license as Ak5. While visually FNC is similar to the FAL rifle, mechanically it works somewhat differently. It uses a gas-operated long-stroke piston system and a rotating bolt locking mechanism, similar to the AK rifle. Upper receiver is made of stamped steel and lower receiver is made of aluminum alloy to save weight - the FNC weights relatively light at 3.84kg. Among it's strong sides are it's reliability, durability, relatively good ergonomics and effective flash hider mounted by default. Good sights layout provides long sight line, increasing the practical accuracy. FNC became available on the black market in The Zone where it came from Libya.

Contrary to it's name, it was not developed by Heckler and Koch, but Fleming Arms for British Special Forces. The G3 is a 7.62x51mm battle rifle designed and manufactured by Heckler and Koch in former West Germany in 1950s. In 1956 the West German Border Guards adopted FN FAL rifles as their service weapons. It left great impression and the Germans decided to make their own battle rifle of similar construction and function. Mechanically, G3 is a battle rifle of all-steel construction using a roller-delayed blowback action. The weapon was designed to use as much stamped steel parts as possible to reduce the cost. Early G3 rifles also used stamped steel handguards, but they were later changed to polymer ones. The HK51 is just a shortened G3, which improves it's handling but reduces reliability and makes the rifle overheat quicker. Another downside is brighter muzzle flash and louder sound signature together with increased recoil, which is already pretty high due to powerful 7.62x51mm round it uses. The round also loses some of it's muzzle velocity, which lowers it's power. The HK51 got adopted by SAS and SBS, but because of it's faults it was withdrawn quickly after the SAS received HK53 carbines, which used 5.56x45mm rounds that were more suitable for commando-length (~9-12.5" barrel) carbines. HK51 was later introduced into free market in semi-automatic variant, made from HK91 rifles (civilian semi-auto variant of G3). Small amount of these weapons reached black market and appeared in multiple places, including The Zone in Ukraine. Due to it's powerful round it is used as an effective weapon against mutants, as it is light, short and has high rate of fire - it can unload whole magazine of 7.62mm soft-point rounds very quickly, which is important when fighting dangerous mutants in melee range. \n \n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Reliability: %c[0,170,170,170]above average\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Durability: %c[0,170,170,170]above average\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Ergonomics: %c[0,170,170,170]above average %c[0,140,140,140] \n \n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] ATTACHMENTS: 7.62mm caliber compatible suppressor</text>

It is designed from the beginning as a police sniper rifle for maximum precision. It boasts very high accuracy, but is also extremely expensive, which finally led to decline of sales. The works on the sniper rifle began after 1972 Munich massacre, which shown weaknesses of counter-terrorist forces back then. The Germans needed a semi-automatic rifle that would provide highest precision possible and that's how PSG-1 came into existence. Mechanically it is just like G3, it's a rifle of all-steel construction using a roller-delayed blowback action. Differences are the modifications for precision shooting purposes. PSG-1 has a heavy free-floating barrel with polygonal rifling, an adjustable stock made of strengthened polymer, a precision trigger that can be easily replaced for individual fitting, a tripod and suppressor. The default scope is Hensoldt ZF PSG-1 6x42 scope with an illuminated reticle. That magnification is a little too low for military shooting on far ranges (scopes from long before PSG-1 creation easily had 12x magnification), but it is usually enough for what the PSG-1 was designed for, the police sniper use. Nonetheless, the low-power scope choice was often criticized and new versions have interchangeable scopes of high-power magnification. The PSG-1's accuracy is close to that of bolt-action sniper rifles, which is exceptional for semi-automatic weapon. The main disadvantage is it's weight, which basically limits it mostly to stationary use. Another is the incredibly high price. The PSG-1 is one of the most expensive semi-automatic sniper rifles available, with a new rifle costing as much as 10.000$ per unit. \n \n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Reliability: %c[0,170,170,170]high\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Durability: %c[0,170,170,170]above average\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Ergonomics: %c[0,170,170,170]low %c[0,140,140,140] \n \n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] ATTACHMENTS: Hensoldt ZF PSG-1 6x42 scope (permanent)</text>

It was developed as a scaled-down famous G3 rifle rechambered to a smaller cartridge, which later became NATO service round. It didn't gain as much fame as G3, but is nonetheless considered a very good and effective weapon, which, just like G3, works reliably in all conditions and can withstand continuous abuse. Mechanically, it is pretty much just like G3. It is an assault rifle of all-steel construction using a roller-delayed blowback action. The weapon was designed to use as much stamped steel parts as possible to reduce the cost, with the furniture made of strengthened polymer. Despite stamped steel construction, it is a durable weapon that is hard to break. The barrel has length of 390mm (15.4"), which provides good ballistics for small 5.56mm bullet that depends on velocity to tumble and fragment properly as a way to deal tissue damage. It is also not as long as other rifles of that time (for example M16A1 had 20" barrel), which improves the handling. The HK33 wasn't adopted by Bundeswehr, but was used by German police and security units and was adopted by multiple countries, most notably Turkey, Malaysia, Greece and special forces units like Navy SEALS and SAS. High numbers of these rifles, coming most likely from Pakistan region, were sold on black market and hit The Zone, where it is well-liked by stalkers as a relatively cheap, but effective and relatively modern weapon with high accuracy. The 40 round magazine improves the firepower over similar rifles, which can give it a substantial edge in firefights. \n \n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Reliability: %c[0,170,170,170]high\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Durability: %c[0,170,170,170]high\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Ergonomics: %c[0,170,170,170]above average %c[0,140,140,140] \n \n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] ATTACHMENTS: 5.56 caliber compatible suppressor</text>

The HK33 was developed as a scaled-down famous G3 rifle rechambered to a smaller cartridge, which later became NATO service round. HK53 has a very short, 211mm (8.4") barrel, which places it closer to AKS-74u than Colt XM177. Thanks to that, it is very easy to maneuver, but loses even more velocity - the 5.56mm bullet needs certain velocity to properly yaw and fragment in the tissue to deal damage, and barrels shorter than 12" don't provide it. HK53 is also marginally heavier than AKS-74u and XM177. Nonetheless, it was accepted by multiple law enforcement agencies and special forces units, most notably the British SAS. Mechanically, it is pretty much just like G3 and HK33. It is an assault rifle of all-steel construction using a roller-delayed blowback action. The weapon was designed to use as much stamped steel parts as possible to reduce the cost, with the furniture made of strengthened polymer. Despite stamped steel construction, it is a durable weapon that is hard to break. Some of these carbines, coming most likely from Pakistan region, were sold on black market and hit The Zone, where it is considered a more universal alternative to AKS-74u carbines. \n \n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Reliability: %c[0,170,170,170]high\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Durability: %c[0,170,170,170]high\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Ergonomics: %c[0,170,170,170]high %c[0,140,140,140] \n \n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] ATTACHMENTS: 5.56 caliber compatible suppressor</text>

Original design, the HS2000, comes from Croatia, where it was made by HS Produkt for Croatian army. In early 2000s Springfield Armory Co. shown interest in Croatian design and started importing these pistols to USA. Springfield made a deal for licensing rights with HS Produkt and shortly after they made some improvements to HS2000; the improved pistol received the name of Springfield XDM (short for X-treme Duty, M is for Match barrel). The XDM sold excellently and became one of the most popular handguns in USA. The press awarded the XDM the title of Handgun of the Year, twice. More than 30 variants of XDM are offered, chambered in 9x19mm, .40SW, .45ACP and .357SIG, with barrel lengths of 3", 4" and 5.25", all designed for different niche. Mechanically, the HS2000 is a short recoil-operated, locked breech, striker fired semi-automatic pistol. The frame is made out of strong polymer with metal slide. Trigger is of moderate weight and can be replaced with lighter, match-grade one for higher accuracy. Variant chambered in 9x19mm holds 16 rounds in magazine, while .40 and .45 variants have 13 rounds capacity. Overally, the HS2000/XDM pistols are light, reliable, accurate and provide high capacity, all for low price. The pistol was however criticized for high bore axis which increases felt recoil and inconsistent quality control, as some pistols were found to be prone to breakage and stoppages. Those are however rare cases, and this weapon is considered by many to be amongst the best handguns currently available on market. It got adopted by Croatian military and various police departments in USA and Europe. It is also popular among civilian gun owners. In The Zone a lot of these pistols reached black market or were taken from homes by stalkers. Like all other modern 9x19mm pistols, the HS2000/XDMs are well liked and considered a solid choice for personal defense.\n \n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Reliability: %c[0,170,170,170]above average\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Durability: %c[0,170,170,170]above average\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Ergonomics: %c[0,170,170,170]average %c[0,140,140,140] \n \n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] ATTACHMENTS: 9mm caliber compatible suppressor</text>

It was developed by IMI (now IWI) in 1990s in cooperation with famous Czech (formerly Czechoslovak) Ceska Zbrojovka company and Tanfoglio company of Italy. Design of Jericho pistols is similar to that of Tanfoglio pistols which are themselves based on the famous Czechoslovak CZ-75, by many considered one of the best SA/DA pistols of that time. J941 was first designed in 9x19mm Parabellum and in .41 Action Express cartridge. .41 AE had ballistics similar to .40SW, but was designed to be used in 9x19mm pistols with minimal modifications (new barrel and return spring, and possibly new magazine), and thus had a rebated rim of the same diameter as the 9x19mm cartridge. Early Jericho pistols were often shipped with two sets of barrels and springs, one in 9x19mm and another in .41AE. Since .41AE wasn't a successful cartridge, later on the pistols were made in 9x19mm, with .40SW and .45ACP variants to follow up later. Mechanically, the Jericho is a locked breech, short recoil operated pistol. The frame and slide are all steel (compact variants were available in polymer frames too). Barrel has polygonal rifling, the trigger is SA/DA and provides relatively good accuracy. The drawback of Jericho is heavy weight and it's big dimensions with rather awkward grip, which both result in below average ergonomics. Nonetheless, the Jericho is a solid and reliable gun, on par with other steel-framed 9x19mm pistols. It was adopted by 14 countries' police and military forces, including Israeli military and security forces. It is also produced in Ukraine from 2009 under the name Fort-21.03 and is used by police and special forces, including military units carrying operations inside the Exclusion Zone. It is sometimes seen on black market in The Zone, where it is relatively popular together with other 9x19mm pistols, which are considered an upgrade over older Soviet-era 9x18mm pistols.\n \n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Reliability: %c[0,170,170,170]high\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Durability: %c[0,170,170,170]above average\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Ergonomics: %c[0,170,170,170]below average %c[0,140,140,140] \n \n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] ATTACHMENTS: 9mm caliber compatible suppressor</text>

It is based on AR-15 rifle and is designed for the PDW role similarly to P90 and MP7. The KAC PDW combines new and off the shelf components in its design. The lower receiver, holding the magazine and trigger assembly, is essentially a shortened M16 rifle (AR-15) lower receiver, which makes the basic operating controls familiar to many potential users. Mechanically, AR-15 is a gas operated firearm that uses direct gas impingement system with a rotating bolt. The rifle has a straight-line recoil design, which reduces the muzzle rise to minimum. KAC PDW has two gas pistons tapping hot gas from the barrel to operate its mechanism, located on the top left and right sides of the bolt carrier. The cartridge, upper receiver, and operating mechanism are all new designs by KAC. The KAC PDW fires a 6x35 mm cartridge, a full centimeter shorter than the western military standard 5.56x45mm NATO round. The 6mm bullet is slightly wider, and the standard 6x35mm bullet slightly heavier than the standard 5.56x45mm bullet. Fired from a 10-inch (250 mm) barrel, KAC claims that the 6x35mm cartridge reaches a muzzle velocity of 750m/s, slightly faster than the muzzle velocity of a 5.56mm cartridge fired from a similarly short barrel. The larger and shorter 6mm cartridge is optimized for these shorter barrel lengths, and would perform less efficiently from rifle-length barrels. KAC PDW was adopted only by US Secret Service and one PMC corporation. Some of them were later found in The Zone, but since the ammunition is not available (only way are handloads) those few KAC PDWs that were found reached black market mostly only as a curiosity. \n \n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Reliability: %c[0,170,170,170]average\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Durability: %c[0,170,170,170]average\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Ergonomics: %c[0,170,170,170]very high %c[0,140,140,140] \n \n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] ATTACHMENTS: ACOG scope, 6.5mm, 7.62mm or higher caliber compatible suppressor</text>

It is one of the most famous rifles in the world, widely considered the best service rifle of entire WWII - General Patton called it "the greatest battle implement ever devised". M1 was developed in 1930s by John Garand, Canadian-American weapons designer, and was adopted by US Army in 1936, replacing Sprinfield M1903 bolt-action rifle. More than 5 million of M1 Garand rifles were produced, and they greatly increased the firepower of US infantry squads compared to typical squad of other countries, who used bolt-action rifles (not counting Germany, whose firepower was provided by a belt-fed machine gun). Mechanically, M1 is a gas operated firearm, using a long-stroke gas piston system with rotating bolt. It is fed by unique en-bloc clip holding 8 rounds. The M1 rifle was chambered in .30-06 Springfield round (7.62x63mm), which was standard cartridge back then, but small amount of these rifles was converted to .308 Win after the war (so called Navy Garands). Advantages of M1 Garand were high firepower, easy and quick reloading and satisfactory accuracy. It's drawbacks were heavy weight and slightly lower reliability than other rifles. It was also less accurate than bolt-action rifles on longer distances, which made them less effective as scoped rifle (two scoped variants were made, M1C and M1D). After the war, M1 Garand rifles were used by multiple countires, mostly those who received them as military aid from US, like Brazil, Denmark, Iran, South Korea, Turkey or South Vietnam. M1 rifles are also used by hunters, sport shooters and civilian gun enthusiasts. In Europe they are very rare, but some of them were imported from Vietnam and Philippines, reaching high prices on collector market. Some were probably stolen, as they appeared in The Zone as hunting rifles. \n \n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Reliability: %c[0,170,170,170]above average\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Durability: %c[0,170,170,170]average\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Ergonomics: %c[0,170,170,170]average </text>

Glock 17 is a full-size pistol chambered in 9x19mm round. It can be distinguished from Glock 19 by slightly longer barrel and longer grip with magazine holding 17 rounds. It is striker fired with medium-weight trigger and three independent safety mechanisms (with no classic safety lever), which make it fit for carrying with a round in a chamber and no need to disengage external safety - the gun can be shot immediately after drawing it from holster, which is a big advantage over classic hammer-fired pistols. Glock pistols have a new type of hammer-forged barrel with polygonal rifling, which slightly improves durability and accuracy, and also makes it easier to clean. The frame is made entirely out of reinforced polymer, which saves weight and is immune to corrosion. Despite initial concerns, the polymer slide was proven to be actually more resistant than some all-steel constructions, it is also resistant to heat and caustic chemicals. The slide is made out of steel and has Tenifer (ferritic nitrocarburized) finish, which is extremely hard and makes the gun very durable and resistant to wear and corrosion on levels exceeding these of stainless steel and chrome lining. Glocks were adopted by multiple countries' armies, special forces units (eg. Navy SEALS, Delta, SAS and Russian Spetsnaz) and countless police departments. 27 different variants of Glock pistols were designed, including full-size, compact and sub-compact size pistols available in different chamberings, mostly 9x19mm,.40SW and .45ACP. Due to very high reliability and durability of parts it was dubbed "AK of pistols". In the Central and Eastern Europe Glock is the most popular handgun, with CZ-75, P99 and Makarov right behind.

It was developed as a replacement for aging Makarov pistols, chambered in weaker 9x18mm cartridge. Mechanically, MP-443 is a steel-frame, short recoil operated, locked breech pistol. It uses a Double-Action trigger, which is relatively stiff and lowers practical accuracy, it does however improve safety. Slide and frame are made from carbon steel, barrel is made of stainless steel to prevent rusting. Hammer is external, but is covered to prevent snaggling on clothes and equipment. It uses a double stack magazine which holds 17 rounds of 9x19mm Parabellum ammunition. The pistol is made to withstand high-pressure loads of 9x19mm, such as 7N21 - the +P+ armor-piercing cartridge. MP-443 Grach is a sturdy pistol with high capacity. On the other hand, it has already aging construction, and all-steel design makes it way heavier than western competitors like Glock. The double-action trigger is also a requirement for police and not military weapon. Overally, the MP-443 is a controversial handgun and isn't well liked by all of the soldiers, however, it is definitely an upgrade over older PM pistols which were more suited for concealed carrying by policemen than as a sidearm for soldiers. Also the use of more powerful 9x19mm ammunition must be noted, as the MP-443 can use multiple types of ammunition, including expanding, tracer and armor-piercing rounds. Grach is currently only used by Russian army and law enforcement and Kazakhstan security companies.

The design was produced only in small numbers before the company went bankrupt. Subsequent attempts to bring the firearm back into production have been unsuccessful. The Bren Ten was the handgun story of the early- to mid-1980s. The pundits drooled and salivated. It was predicted that the new cartridge that came out with it, the 10mm Auto, would take over the law enforcement market. It was not to be. Today, the 10mm is popular only among handgun cognoscenti. The Bren Ten itself has long since languished on the ash heap of firearms history. Its creator, the legend Jeff Cooper, wrote in his column in the April 2004 Guns and Ammo: "The Bren Ten was a concept of mine, and while I am not ashamed of it, I admit that this concept was not entirely sound." The words had the ring of a eulogy.

After the XM8 failure, HK decided to enter US market with new product - AR-15 rifle upgrade. The AR-15 is an American 5.56x45mm assault rifle developed by Eugene Stoner in 1960s. It was designed as a lightweight automatic rifle using a modern, light, small-bore ammunition which allowed the soldier to carry more ammunition. It was adopted as service rifle of US military as M16 rifle and M4 carbine, among others. These weapons were successful, as they're very ergonomic, easy to use, provide high firepower and boast very high accuracy; their drawback however was reliability - M4A1 was proven to jam even 3x more often than other rifles. HK416 was designed to fix that issue. AR-15 is a gas operated firearm that uses direct gas impingement system with a rotating bolt. HK416 system uses a short-stroke piston that forces the bolt carrier to the rear; this design prevents combustion gases from entering the weapon's interior — a drawback of direct impingement systems which reduces weapon's reliability and parts life. Other improvements include new buffer assembly, improved bolt, and a cold hammer forged barrel, as well as free-floating handguard with integral Picatinny-type rails, which improve accuracy while also allowing to attach additional equipment and optical sights. Receiver is made from high grade aluminum alloy, which is light and durable. The HK416 is considered by many to be one of the best assault rifles of modern times - it is light, reliable, ergonomic and can be customized to fit operator's needs.

The TEC-9 design was started in Sweden, when the Interdynamic AB company of Stockholm developed a relatively simple submachine gun. Since Sweden was a poor market for such product, a subsidiary company Interdynamic was established in Miami (Florida, USA), to market Interdynamic guns in USA. As the full-automatic weapons market in USA is very restrictive, the basic submachine gun was converted in semi-automatic only variant, apparently suitable for civilian US market. This semi-automatic pistol, like its submachine gun predecessor, was a simple blowback design, firing from the open bolt, which made it easy to conver to fire in fully-automatic mode. Mechanically, AB-10/TEC-9 pistols are blowback operated, semi-automatic weapons firing from open bolt. The receivers of all versions are made from steel tube, the frames are made from polymer, integral with pistol grip and magazine housing ahead of the trigger guard. The tubular receiver is hinged to the front of the frame. There is no manual safety. Permanently fixed open sights were not adjustable, and often misaligned. Usually these weapons had questionable quality, but were very cheap and simple. The TEC-9 developed a negative reputation for its association with organized crime and mass shootings in the 1990s, getting itself a nickname of a "hood blaster". A lot of these weapons, converted illegally to automatic fire, found their way to the black market, including arms dealers in The Zone who sell them as cheap substitute of more refined PDWs and machine pistols. \n \n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Reliability: %c[0,170,170,170]average\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Durability: %c[0,170,170,170]below average\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Ergonomics: %c[0,170,170,170]below average %c[0,140,140,140] \n \n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] ATTACHMENTS: 9mm-caliber compatible suppressor</text>

AKS-74u (also known as Krinkov (in USA), Ksyuha, Suchka or Okurok) is a compact carbine variant of AK-74 rifle. It was developed around the time of AK-74's adoption and was intended as a personal defense weapon for vehicles' crews, helicopter pilots, special forces operators and personnel that didn't need long rifles or had trouble carrying one. It is way shorter than typical infantry rifle and is even slightly shorter than comparable weapons of it's era like XM177 or HK53. Mechanically it uses AK-74 gas action, but due to problems with insufficient pressure from shorter barrel, a special gas system was designed for it. In tactical sense it's something between a carbine and submachine gun - it has a 206mm (8") long barrel and a folding stock, which makes it lighter and way more maneuverable in close quarters than long AK-74 rifle. It's a controversial weapon - on one hand, it is light and compact, on the other, it has higher recoil than submachine gun, it's accurate only to about 100-150 meters and it overheats quickly. It is praised by some and hated by others. It became a popular weapon in The Zone for those who don't participate in fights but need something to defend themselves from mutants and bandits, and don't want a long and heavy rifle that would reduce the amount of loot they could carry due to it's weight and size.\n \n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Reliability: %c[0,170,170,170]high\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Durability: %c[0,170,170,170]high\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Ergonomics: %c[0,170,170,170]above average %c[0,140,140,140] \n \n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] ATTACHMENTS: Aimpoint CompM2 reflex sight (permanent), 5.56 caliber compatible suppressor</text>

They use an unconventional delayed blowback system combined with in-line design to reduce felt recoil and muzzle climb of the weapon. Vector shoots with incredibly high cyclic rate of 1200 rounds per minute (for comparison, MP5 has rate of 800RPM), but recoil reducing mechanism makes it easy to control. Mechanically, Vector is a delayed blowback operated submachine gun, firing from closed bolt for enhanced first-shot accuracy. Very light bolt is connected to the vertically sliding weight, which is located within a polymer housing in front of the pistol grip. Firing controls include ambidextrous fire mode selector switch, located on the upper receiver, with settings for fully automatic, 2-round burst and semi-automatic mode and a separate ambidextrous manual safety switch, which is conveniently located just above the pistol grip. The weapon is fed from Glock magazines in various sizes, most notably of 13, 25 and 33 rounds capacity, which are very cheap and readily available all around the world. The Vector uses an articulated mechanism referred to as the "KRISS Super V," which allows the bolt and an inertia block to move downward into a recess behind the magazine well. The theory is that at the end of this travel, the energy is transmitted downward rather than rearward, thus reducing the felt recoil. When fired, the barrel axis is in line with the shoulder as in the M16 rifle, but also in line with the shooter's hand. This is intended to reduce muzzle climb when combined with the off-axis bolt travel. Vector is a relatively successful weapon and was adopted by multiple users, mainly police departments and security agencies in Europe (mostly the 9x19mm version), but was also received warmly on civilian market where it is sold in semi-automatic-only version (in USA it is sold with long, 16" barrel because of specific gun laws). In The Zone it is used by mercenary groups and loners who need a compact and light weapon for use as PDW, but due to it's extremely high rate of fire it is also used as weapon for mutant hunting - even short burst can send a lot bullets down range, increasing the chance of critical hit. \n \n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Reliability: %c[0,170,170,170]above average\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Durability: %c[0,170,170,170]above average\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Ergonomics: %c[0,170,170,170]high %c[0,140,140,140] \n \n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] ATTACHMENTS: Walther MRS reflex sight (permanent), .45 caliber compatible suppressor</text>

It became popular as a hunting, police and military rifle since it's introduction in the 1980s. These rifles have features that improve their performance in very cold conditions, without impairing operation in normal weather. AI PM (Precision Marksman) rifle was designed in the early 1980s as a new sniper rifle for the British Army and was accepted into service as L96. Some time after the Swedish military also desired a new rifle, and in the early 1990s AI entered with an upgraded version of the PM, now known as the AW (Arctic Warfare). Special de-icing features allowed it to be used effectively at temperatures as low as ?40 °C (?104 °F). The AW rifle featured a modified bolt with milled slots to prevent freezing and problems caused by penetrating water, dirt or similar disturbances. It was accepted into use by the Swedish Army in 1991 and steadily became increasingly popular due to it's extreme durability, reliability and precision (up to 0.5MOA). The chassis is made of alluminum, the flat-sided receiver is a stressed part, machined in-house by AI from a solid piece of forged carbon steel. The bolt handle is bent to the rear, which makes it's operating easier. AW has a heavy, free-floating barrel and a light two-stage trigger. Overally, the AW is one of the most reliable and precise sniper rifle in the world. It was adopted by multiple military and police units around the world, most notably UK (as L96 and L118), USA, Sweden, Australia, Germany, Czech Republic and even Russia, who usually prefer their own designs. Despite the fact it's very expensive, the AW also became popular among hunters and civilian marksmen, who greatly value it's high accuracy. Since bolt action rifles are easily available on civilian market, more wealthy stalkers use these rifles as hunting rifles to shoot dangerous mutants from long distance, on which they themselves stay safe. \n \n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Reliability: %c[0,170,170,170]very high\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Durability: %c[0,170,170,170]very high\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Ergonomics: %c[0,170,170,170]above average %c[0,140,140,140] \n \n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] ATTACHMENTS: 12x Schmidt and Bender 3-12x50 sniper scope (permanent)</text>

Over 6 millions of these weapons were produced, more than any other US WWII weapon. After the war the M1 was used up until Vietnam war by US and even longer by more than 50 other countries (from which at least five use it up to this day) who used it, mainly South Vietnam, South Korea, Italy, Taiwan, Norway and France. M1 Carbine was sold in big numbers on civilian market in US, where it is very popular as a home defense and small-game hunting weapon, it was also used for hunting in Europe, albeit in smaller numbers.

It was designed as a cheap weapon fit for rapid mass production in style of Sten and PPS-43 submachine guns. Before the M3, the US military's service submachine gun was Thompson M1928A1. It was a very good weapon, but it was very heavy and extremely expensive in production, which limited the production capability of US war industry. M3 was made to fix this issue. It was a fully automatic, blowback-operated weapon that fired from an open bolt. Manufactured of plain sheet steel, the M3 receiver was stamped in two halves that were then welded together. To save time and cost, the barrel was cold-swaged. The weapon was not well finished and the appearance of M3 is very crude as it was rushed to reduce the cost as much as possible, it was only finished as much as to allow the weapon to function properly. Because of crude, industrial aesthetics, the M3 was called the "Greaser" or "Grease Gun". Nonetheless, it was a relatively reliable weapon that was "just-good-enough" for war time. Slow rate of fire improved the controllability of the weapon and allowed for more accurate fire even in long bursts. Single shots could also be fired without the need for fire selector. More than 600 000 of these guns were produced in only two years of 1943-1945. The Grease Gun remained in service with US military up to Vietnam war, and was even used as late as in 1990s by Abrams crews because of their compact size. It was used by multiple countries after the war, among them Vietnam, France, Afghanistan, Phillipines and Mexico. A lot of M3A1s reached black market in South America and Asia, some of them reached The Zone from Phillipines and Vietnam - they are used as cheap alternative to more modern submachine guns, but due to excessive weight they usually aren't well liked and are used only by those who can't afford more modern weapons. \n \n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Reliability: %c[0,170,170,170]average\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Durability: %c[0,170,170,170]average\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Ergonomics: %c[0,170,170,170]above average %c[0,140,140,140] \n \n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] ATTACHMENTS: none</text>

It was based on Mossberg 500, the classic series of pump-action shotguns produced in multiple variants, chamberings and furniture sets. Mossberg shotguns are popular in law enforcement agencies and police departments, as well as among civilian gun owners and hunters. They are regarded as high-quality weapons that are dependable and of high quality. These shotguns utilize pump action, which is operated by a sliding forend. The forend is connected with the bolt group. The receiver is produced from lightweight aluminum alloy. Ammunition is fed from the tubular magazine that is located under the barrel. “Militarization” of Mossberg 500 into 590 included strengthening of the receiver and other parts, installation of the vented heat shield around the barrel, bayonet lug and extended magazine, as well as an aluminum trigger guard instead of a plastic one. Standard finish is of 590 is parkerizing, and the gun is usually provided with replacement pistol grip, which allows easy conversion to ‘Cruiser’ modification and back. Mossberg 590 was officially adopted into US Army and Marine Corps. While it was officially replaced in the US Army with the Benelli M1014 semi-automatic shotgun, Mossberg 590 shotguns are still widely used by the US Navy and Marine Corps. Pump action shotguns are popular in both the USA and Europe, and some stalkers brought these weapons, often legally owned, along with them into The Zone, where they are primarily used for defense against wild animals and mutants or hunting them. Like all other shotguns, the Mossberg 590 is liked for the sheer power that the 12 gauge shells provide. \n \n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Reliability: %c[0,170,170,170]high\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Durability: %c[0,170,170,170]high\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Ergonomics: %c[0,170,170,170]above average %c[0,140,140,140] \n \n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] ATTACHMENTS: none </text>

It was designed in response for US Army Armament Research Center request for a new 12 gauge semi-automatic shotgun for the US military. The M4 was the first gas-operated shotgun produced by Benelli. Its function is designed around an entirely new method called the "auto regulating gas operated" (ARGO) system, which provides an efficient cycling for the weapon. Additionally, the weapon is self-regulating for use with cartridges of varying length and power levels (for example the buckshot and the breaching rounds, which have different energy). The sights are military-style ghost ring and are adjustable. On top of the receiver a RIS rail is mounted by default, allowing for use of any optical sight of choice. The modular basis of the shotgun means many of its features can be reconfigured as needed. It allows a user to quickly exchange the various assembly groups (barrel, buttstock, forearm, etc.) without the use of tools. The Benelli M4 was adopted by US military in 1999 as M1014 and still serves. It is also used by militaries of another 20 countries, where it is used with great success. Users praise it's high quality, reliability and effectiveness. In The Zone, the Benelli M4 is mostly seen in hands of PMC mercenaries; some hunter squads also use the M4s due to their high firepower and higher rate of fire compared to classic pump-action shotguns. \n \n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Reliability: %c[0,170,170,170]high\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Durability: %c[0,170,170,170]high\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Ergonomics: %c[0,170,170,170]above average %c[0,140,140,140] \n \n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] ATTACHMENTS: none </text>

Mechanically, the Mauser C96 is a recoil operated, locked breech, semi-automatic pistol. The distinctive characteristics of the C96 are the integral box magazine in front of the trigger. The whole pistol is made of metal with wooden handguards, most C96 pistols also have an option to add a wooden stock, which doubles as a holster. Overally, the C96 is a big pistol with relatively low handling, but it is pretty reliable, durable and accurate. It uses 7.63x25mm cartridge which is almost exact in dimensions to Soviet 7.62x25mm TT round (which was actually based on Mauser round). While TT pistol can use 7.63 Mauser rounds, the C96 shouldn't use 7.62 TT - the TT round produces much higher pressure. The round will chamber and fire without problems, but the gun will wear out much faster and can even explode. Mauser C96 was produced in more than a million copies. The M712 "Schnellfeuer" ("Quick-firing") variant could fire in full-auto mode and was also very popular. There was also 9x19mm variant called "Red Nine" (because it had a "9" stamped in red on the grip). The C96 and M712 were used by Germany in both world wars, Austria-Hungary, Russia (and USSR), Spain, Vietnam and China. China also produced their own C96 and M712 copies. Some of these guns survived all this time and remain in private hands Europe, some of them reached The Zone where they were brought by stalkers for personal protection.

Mechanically, the Mauser C96 is a recoil operated, locked breech, semi-automatic pistol. The distinctive characteristics of the C96 are the integral box magazine in front of the trigger. The whole pistol is made of metal with wooden handguards, most C96 pistols also have an option to add a wooden stock, which doubles as a holster. Overally, the C96 is a big pistol with relatively low handling, but it is pretty reliable, durable and accurate. It uses 7.63x25mm cartridge which is almost exact in dimensions to Soviet 7.62x25mm TT round (which was actually based on Mauser round). While TT pistol can use 7.63 Mauser rounds, the C96 shouldn't use 7.62 TT - the TT round produces much higher pressure. The round will chamber and fire without problems, but the gun will wear out much faster and can even explode. Mauser C96 was produced in more than a million copies. The M712 "Schnellfeuer" ("Quick-firing") variant could fire in full-auto mode and was also very popular. There was also 9x19mm variant called "Red Nine" (because it had a "9" stamped in red on the grip). The C96 and M712 were used by Germany in both world wars, Austria-Hungary, Russia (and USSR), Spain, Vietnam and China. China also produced their own C96 and M712 copies. Some of these guns survived all this time and remain in private hands Europe, some of them reached The Zone where they were brought by stalkers for personal protection. C96 is heavy and unwieldy, but is nonetheless better than nothing. \n \n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Reliability: %c[0,170,170,170]above average\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Durability: %c[0,170,170,170]below average\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Ergonomics: %c[0,170,170,170]good %c[0,140,140,140] \n \n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] ATTACHMENTS: Wooden stock (permanent)</text>

Main difference between MG3 and MG42 is chambering - MG3 uses modern 7.62x51mm NATO rounds. The MG42 is a German machine gun developed as a successor to MG34, which was a very good weapon, but was expensive to manufacture. MG42 was made entirely from stamped sheet metal, which made it a cheap and simple. Despite it's simplicity, the MG42 proved to be extremely reliable and effective machine gun. Mechanically, the MG42/MG3 is a short-recoil operated, air cooled, belt fed weapon which fires from an open bolt. The barrel is quick-changeable, and can be replaced in less than six seconds by a properly trained crew, although a heatproof glove is required to remove the hot barrel. The action uses a recoil-operated roller locking mechanism, later used in HK weapons. The MG42 had insane rate of fire of 1200RPM, which produced a terrifying sound. The ear could not easily discern the sound of individual shots being fired, instead hearing a sound described as like "ripping cloth" or a buzzsaw. It was enough to pin down entire allied squad and stop their advance until the MG nest was destroyed. MG3 has the fire rate lowered to 800-900RPM, but it can be changed back to 1200 by replacing the bolt. The receiver and barrel jacket are made in one unit, and formed from a sheet of rolled steel, cut to shape by pressing and stamping. The gun is fed using belts only. MG42/MG3 have two points for bipod attachment, one near the muzzle and another near the center of the gun. MG3 is still considered one of the finest machine guns in use. It is still used by more than 20 countries, among them Germany, Austria, Denmark, Italy and many more. Some of these weapons were sent to Middle East, from where part of them found their way to black market. In The Zone MG3s are relatively rare, but are very well liked for their reliability, durability and extremely high rate of fire, which make them perfect as suppresion platform or anti-mutant weapon. Some mutant hunters modify their MG3s with front grips, new stocks and optics to optimise them for hip-fire. \n \n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Reliability: %c[0,170,170,170]high\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Durability: %c[0,170,170,170]high\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Ergonomics: %c[0,170,170,170]low %c[0,140,140,140] \n \n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] ATTACHMENTS: Front grip (permanent) </text>

The MP-153 shotgun uses more or less conventional gas-operated action with annular piston, located around the magazine tube. Gas system features self-adjusting gas valve which allows to fire a wide variety of loads. It feeds from magazine tube holding 4 rounds (the capacity can be extended). The receiver of MP-153 is made from aluminum forging, stocks(for end and buttstock) are available in wood or polymer. Barrels can be easily removed, and available in a variety of lengths. Barrels are equipped with interchangeable choke system. Baikal MP-153 is considered a well made and effective weapon. Semi-automatic shotguns are popular in law enforcement agencies and police departments, as well as among civilian gun owners and hunters. Semi-automatic shotguns are popular in both the USA and Europe, and some stalkers brought these weapons, often legally owned, along with them into The Zone, where they are primarily used for defense against wild animals and mutants or hunting them. Like all other shotguns, the MP-153 is liked for the sheer power that the 12 gauge shells provide and higher rate of fire compared to pump-action shotguns, which greatly improves the firepower. \n \n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Reliability: %c[0,170,170,170]high\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Durability: %c[0,170,170,170]high\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Ergonomics: %c[0,170,170,170]above average %c[0,140,140,140] \n \n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] ATTACHMENTS: none </text>

Best used in close range. %c[0,140,140,140]  \n \n%c[0,170,170,170]PP-2000 was developed for and adopted into law enforcement agencies in 2004. It's intended use is as a personal defense weapon - it has compact, simplified construction and has increased parts durability to make it adapted to shoot more powerful 7N21 and 7N31 armor-piercing 9x19mm rounds, which are loaded to very high pressures for improved performance, but cause high stress to weapon parts that can result in increased wear and even breakage. PP-2000 is developed as an answer to western types of PDWs and fills the same niche. It is a compact weapon which can be easily carried or concealed, shoots ammunition which is weaker than assault rifle, but can still penetrate body armor and can shoot in long bursts without big loss in accuracy. The difference is mainly in ammunition used. While P90 and MP7 use small-bore rounds that are visually basically short assault rifle rounds (5.7x28mm and 4.6x30mm) and work as such, the PP-2000 uses standard 9x19mm ammunition, but in modified variants. 7N21 and 7N31 are loaded to very high pressures (+P and +P+) and produce high muzzle velocity. This way they can do the same job as formerly mentioned PDW rounds, but user can also load standard 9x19mm rounds in various types into the weapon if needed - this makes PP-2000 more universal than P90 and MP7. The only advantage is that P90 and MP7 ammunition produces negligible recoil, which allow them to shoot even long bursts without loss of accuracy due to muzzle climb. Still, almost all 9x19mm submachines have controllable recoil and PP-2000 is no different, so it's still not a big issue. Mechanically, PP-2000 is a blowback operated weapon firing from closed bolt which improves accuracy. The bolt is of telescopic type, similar to the one used in Sa vz.26 and later in Uzi SMG. \n \n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Reliability: %c[0,170,170,170]above average\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Durability: %c[0,170,170,170]high\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Ergonomics: %c[0,170,170,170]above average %c[0,140,140,140] \n \n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] ATTACHMENTS: 9mm-caliber compatible suppressor</text>

The Walther PP/PPK is blowback-operated pistol with a fixed barrel of all-metal construction. The trigger is double-action, with an exposed hammer and a frame-mounted manual safety/decocker. Magazines are single-stack; the magazine release button is usually located at the left side of the frame, just below the slide and in front of the grip panel. These pistols are fitted with a loaded chamber indicator. Walther PPK is a famous and influential design. It is probably best known as the primary weapon of James Bond, but it's importance didn't end on popculture. Several pistols were based on PPK, including Makarov PM, Hungarian FEG PA-63, the Polish P-64 and several more. The PP and PPK were both popular with European police and civilians for being reliable and concealable. During World War II, they were issued to the German military, including the Luftwaffe, as well as the police. Today, the PPK still remains relatively popular as a concealed-carry weapon for it's small dimensions and light ammunition. Some stalkers brought their PPK pistols into The Zone with them, where they are sometimes used as backup pistols due to their compactness, typically carried in the pocket or in ankle holster. PPK and it's small 7.65mm bullets are not very effective vs wild animals and mutants, but can save your life when ambushed by bandits.\n \n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Reliability: %c[0,170,170,170]high\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Durability: %c[0,170,170,170]high\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Ergonomics: %c[0,170,170,170]high %c[0,140,140,140] \n \n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] ATTACHMENTS: 9mm or lower caliber compatible suppressor</text>

In the year 1941, operation "Barbarossa" was launched and the Nazi Germany attacked the Soviet Union with Panzer divisions and masses of mechanized infantry. The Soviet anti tank defenses were crippled and they desperately needed a weapon that would give their infantry a chance against German tanks and armored vehicles and would be cheaper and faster to produce than towed anti tank guns. Sergei Simonov designed a semi-automatic weapon that would become a great asset for the Soviets: the PTRS-41 anti-tank rifle. It was a gas-operated firearm that used a powerful 14.5x114mm cartridge, which sent a heavy anti-tank bullet filled with incendiary charge down range with speed of 1013m/s, reaching penetration value of up to 40mm of rolled homogeneous armor on the distance of 100 meters - enough to penetrate side armor of every German tank in early years of war. After German tanks became better armored, the PTRS was used as an anti-materiel rifle. It's high powered round makes it effective in this role, as it can shoot through walls, metal plates and other barriers and incendiary charge allows to effectively destroy equipment. The rifle is however extremely heavy, weighting more than 20kg, and even despite all it's mass the powerful round still has very high recoil, which can cause concussion, disorientation and even dislocate user's shoulder if not handled properly. PTRS is sometimes used in The Zone as a heavy anti-materiel rifle, but it was used with most success as a weapon to dispatch big, dangerous mutants from safe distance - one Duty hunter team allegedly killed a Pseudogiant with only two hits, to the upper torso and then the head, from range of about 620 meters. \n \n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Reliability: %c[0,170,170,170]average\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Durability: %c[0,170,170,170]high\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Ergonomics: %c[0,170,170,170]extremely low </text>

It has an iconic place in American sporting culture and has been held in high regard by shooters since it was introduced in 1936, earning the moniker "The Rifleman's Rifle". The action has some design similarities to Mauser designs and it is a development of the earlier Winchester Model 54. Winchester 70 features new, simpler and easier to operate bolt design, simplified construction for quicker and cheaper production, Mauser action and hammer-forged barrel. It is an accurate and reliable rifle and is the main competitor of the famous Remington 700. It is available in multiple calibers and variants. Some W70 rifles were used by police departments and military forces, among them US Marine Corps who used these rifles in Vietnam together with M40 rifles (military variant of Remington 700). W70 is considered a good platform for a hunting rifle, but tactical and sport shooters often value R700 over W70 due to it's higher modification potential and abundance of aftermarket parts. In The Zone the Winchester 70 is used as hunting rifle or cheap yet effective sniper rifle, just like all other classic bolt-action rifles chambered in standard rifle calibers. \n \n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Reliability: %c[0,170,170,170]very high\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Durability: %c[0,170,170,170]above average\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Ergonomics: %c[0,170,170,170]above average %c[0,140,140,140] \n \n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] ATTACHMENTS: Leupold VX-II 3-9x variable magnification scope (permanent)</text>

It was adopted in 1903 and fought in both World Wars (in WWII, USMC didn't get M1 rifles before the end of 1942 and even after this they weren't rearmed with Garands entirely). It also remained as sniper rifle, used with 2.5x or 8x scopes until the early Vietnam war. Springfield M1903 is a rifle based on the German Mauser Gewehr 98 rifle. Just like Gew98 (or more famous Kar98k, which replaced the Gew98), the Springfield rifle is accurate, has smooth working bolt and works very reliably. It was well-liked and valued by those who used it. Two sniper variants were made, the M1903A1 "Marine" with 7.8x Unertl scope and M1903A4 with 2.5x scope. The Marine variant is considered to be a much better rifle, not only due to it's high-power optics, but also due to it's high quality finish and superior accuracy. Today Springfield rifles are used as target or hunting rifles all around the world. In the Europe Springfields are very rare, nonetheless they are sometimes seen. This specimen seems to come from Asia, where it was probably acquired on black market. It was rechambered to .308 Winchester, probably to cut hunting cost, as .308 ammunition is way cheaper and easier to obtain. \n \n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Reliability: %c[0,170,170,170]very high\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Durability: %c[0,170,170,170]high\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Ergonomics: %c[0,170,170,170]above average %c[0,140,140,140] \n \n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] ATTACHMENTS: Unertl 7.8x magnification scope (permanent)</text>

Experiences of WWII showed a need for improvements to be made to M1 Garand rifle. It was a good and solid semi-automatic rifle, but there was a lot of room for improvement. US military wanted a rifle with higher capacity (like BAR), using modern ammunition (.308 Win/7.62 NATO) and to be lighter than M1, which was excessively heavy. With higher capacity and better controllability, the M14 was meant to replace several weapon types, both the rifle, carbine, automatic rifle (M1918A2 BAR) and submachine gun - soldiers were to be armed entirely with M14s. However, it proved to be an impossible task to replace all these weapons. M14 was too uncontrollable in rapid fire, so it was useless as SMG and BAR replacement, it also didn't offer much over Garand except for higher magazine size. The M14 was also deemed "completely inferior" to the World War II M1 Garand in a 1962 report by the Department of Defense comptroller. M14 was replaced with M16 assault rifle, which was easier to operate, had very low recoil and was more reliable in most conditions. At the end of Vietnam war, M14 was mostly withdrawn. In general, the M14 was a controversial weapon. It had the accuracy and range of the "old time" military rifles, but was too long, heavy and lacked the automatic fire firepower of a true assault rifle, often required in the modern close combat. M14 was a short stroke gas operated firearm with rotating bolt. The gas system has cut-off feature, which limits the amount of gases used to operate the weapon. The stock was entirely made of wood, the receiver was steel. M14 is an obsolete design now, but it is used as a marksman rifle platform thanks to it's accuracy. It is also popular among hunters, civilian variant is produced by Springfield under M1A name. In The Zone, M14 rifles come from hunters or black market from Southeast Asia and are sometimes, albeit rarely, seen used as hunting rifles or sniper platforms with scopes. \n \n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Reliability: %c[0,170,170,170]average\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Durability: %c[0,170,170,170]average\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Ergonomics: %c[0,170,170,170]average %c[0,140,140,140] \n \n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] ATTACHMENTS: none</text>

The design was generally based on American firearms inventor John Browning's Browning Hi-Power design. Vis was accepted in 1935 and was the service pistol of Polish Army. After the Nazi Germany defeated Poland in 1939, they occupied FB Radom and produced these pistols for their own use. More than 360 thousands of these pistols were produced, with most being captured by Germans. The Vis pistol is a single-action, hammer-fired, locked-breech design. The control on the slide is a decocking mechanism that releases the hammer while camming the firing pin up into the slide. Vis is considered one of the finest pistols of World War II. It's advantages are high accuracy, high reliability and very high production quality. When in German service, they were usually used by officers and soldiers of elite formations, like Fallschirmjaegers. Vis' drawbacks are typical for pistols of it's time and include low capacity of 8 rounds and relatively heavy weight because of all-steel construction. Nonetheless, when compared to other WWII designs, Vis is definitely one of the best pistols of that time, on par with M1911 and Browning HP.

Lowered weight and good handling. %c[0,140,140,140]  \n \n%c[0,170,170,170]Ithaca Stakeout is short version Model 37 with a 13 inches (330 mm) barrel and pistol grip stock for improved maneuverability. Ithaca Model 37 is an American pump-action shotgun made in large numbers for the civilian, military, and police purposes. It utilizes a novel combination ejection/loading port on the bottom of the gun which leaves the sides closed to the elements. The Model 37 is considered one of the most durable and reliable shotguns ever produced. The Ithaca 37 is based on a 1915 patent by the famous firearms designer John Browning, initially marketed as the Remington Model 17. Made in many different models, the Ithaca 37 has the longest production run for a pump-action shotgun in history, surpassing that of the Winchester Model 12 that had originally inspired Ithaca to produce pump-action shotguns. M37 has classic design, with pump-action mechanism and tubular magazine under the barrel. Pump action shotguns are popular in both the USA and Europe, and some stalkers brought these weapons, often legally owned, along with them into The Zone, where they are primarily used for defense against wild animals and mutants or hunting them. Like all other shotguns, the Ithaca M37 is liked for the sheer power that the 12 gauge shells provide. Shortened shotguns like the Stakeout are used exclusively for personal defense, as they doesn't have enough range and velocity (due to shorter barrel muzzle velocity is lower and the projectiles have less energy than when shot from longer barreled shotguns) to be used effectively for hunting. It can however deal very high damage in short range and potentially bring down most mutants or human attackers in one well placed shot.

It was the first light machine gun that used the intermediate rounds and had a handguard to make it more ergonomic and allow firing from the hip - low recoil from intermediate cartridge and easier handling made it more universal than other portable machine guns of these times, such as MG42. It was developed in 1944 as a light machine gun chambered in 7.62x39mm M43 cartridge as a more universal replacement for DP-28 light machine gun, which used full-power 7.62x54mmR ammunition stored in pan magazines. While it was quickly replaced in Soviet military by RPK light machine gun, it became adopted by multiple countries who received them as military aid. It was most notably used as the service machine gun of North Vietnamese Army and gained respect of American troops. Mechanically, RPD is a gas operated firearm which uses long stroke gas piston with bolt locking system with locking flaps, similar to the one used in the DP-27 light machine gun. The weapon is fed from the belt of 50 rounds, which is stored in a so called belt holder (it's not technically a magazine). Each belt holder holds two such belts linked together, which provides ammo capacity of 100 rounds - that's more than twice as much as it's predecessor, the DP-27. The weapon has a heavy, 520mm (20") long barrel, which allows for prolonged firing, however the lack of quick-change mechanism limits it's practical firepower. It is also prone to jamming, which led to it's withdrawal from Soviet army. It is however lighter than typical LMG, easier to handle and has high capacity. All these advantages make it well liked in The Zone - thanks to it's sheer firepower it is often used when hunting hordes of mutants, it's also often employed on outposts and camps as defensive weapon. \n \n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Reliability: %c[0,170,170,170]above average\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Durability: %c[0,170,170,170]high\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Ergonomics: %c[0,170,170,170]low </text>

High damage output. %c[0,140,140,140]  \n \n%c[0,170,170,170]DP-28 is a Soviet light machine gun designed by Vasily Degtyarev in 1920s, chambered in 7.62x54mmR cartridge. It was adopted by Red Army in 1927, eventually becoming one of the most famous weapons of the WWII, later replaced by RPD. DP was cheap and simple LMG. Mechanically, it is an open bolt, gas operated weapon with long stroke gas piston, located under the barrel, which operates a bolt with two side-mounted locking flaps. Ammunition is fed from the top, from unique pan magazine, which holds 47 rounds. Among it's important parts are flash hider, bipod and heavy barrel. Rate of fire is about 550-600rpm, which places it on par with typical magazine-fed LMGs of that era. DP-28 has simple, but sturdy construction and magazine of relatively high capacity - contemporary magazine-fed LMGs, like BAR, Bren or ZB-26 usually held 20-30 rounds in magazine. However, DP also has it's flaws. It's reliability wasn't perfect and the weapon was prone to overheating. Recoil spring was located below the barrel, which made it possible to become damaged from high temperature. The barrel is removable, but requires a tool for removal, and as such can not be considered quick-changeable, like in Bren or ZB-26. Overally, the DP is considered a good weapon, but user must be aware of it's flaws. Near the end of WWII DP-28 was modernized and called DPM, with biggest difference being relocation of recoil spring to the rear and addition of pistol grip. It was also base to another weapon, called RP-46, which was essentially a belt-fed DPM. After WWII the RPD took over as main LMG in Red Army, but DP-28 was used in many countries of Eastern Bloc and those that sided with them, most notably the Yugoslavia, China and Vietnam. Today, a lot of DP-28 are sold as surplus, and some appeared in The Zone. It's heavy weight make it a rather poor choice for scavengers and explorers, but they are liked by mutant hunters due to it's hard-hitting cartridge, which provides higher range and causes more tissue damage than intermediate rounds of RPD and RPK. \n \n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Reliability: %c[0,170,170,170]above average\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Durability: %c[0,170,170,170]above average\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Ergonomics: %c[0,170,170,170]low </text>

It was designed for requirements of US military for new service pistols, but Beretta 92 won the trials due to lower price, despite P226 being superior construction. Nonetheless, it was a successful design and went on to become one of the most popular service pistols all around the world. Mechanically, the P226 is a short-recoil operated, Browning-type locked-breech pistol, just like P220. Differences are in slightly redesigned shape and addition of double stack magazines, which can hold 15 to 18 rounds, depending on magazine type. Default variant is chambered in 9x19mm Parabellum, but there are also .40SW and .357SIG versions. The slide is milled from a single piece of stainless steel with Nitron coating for superior protection from rust and elements, and also to allow shooting hotter loads of .357 SIG and +P 9x19mm. The frame of most models is made from hard anodized aluminum alloy. Addition of decocker allows the pistol to be carried with a round in the chamber, which is very important for a concealed carry weapon. Overally, the P226 is considered to be one of the best pistols currently available. It's extremely durable and resistant to abuse, and provides flawless performance even in harshest environments. It is acclaimed by many special operation forces all around the world and became service weapon of numerous militaries and law enforcement agencies, including those from USA, Germany, UK, Switzerland, Finland, Poland, Netherlands and many more. In The Zone, the P226 is often used by various mercenary groups, as well as special forces operators, foreign expeditions security and various free stalkers who value it's high reliability and effectiveness, despite it's high price compared to other modern 9x19mm pistols.\n \n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Reliability: %c[0,170,170,170]very high\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Durability: %c[0,170,170,170]very high\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Ergonomics: %c[0,170,170,170]above average %c[0,140,140,140] \n \n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] ATTACHMENTS: 9mm caliber compatible suppressor</text>

It is chambered in 9x21mm Gyurza cartridge, which is able to penetrate all kinds of soft body armor, which stopped standard 9x19mm Para and even 7.62x25mm TT rounds. 9x21mm Gyurza cartridge is more powerful than 9x19mm Parabellum, default load contains an armor piercing bullet with hardened steel core, which allows to penetrate body armor on distance of up to 150 meters. Initially SR-1M was developed by TsNIITochMash (famous for AS and VSS rifles) on request of Russian army, who wanted to have a pistol that could kill enemies wearing body armor on distance of 50 meters. The army lost interest in it, but the design was picked up by MVD and in 1996 it was adopted by Federal Security Service (FSB) and various other law enforcment agencies, including Russian elite police units (SWAT equivalent). The SR-1M is a short recoil operated, locked breech pistol, similar in function to Beretta 92 or Walther P38 pistols. It fires a powerful round, but it's quality of finish leaves a lot to desire and it is reported to have reliability problems. Some of these pistols can be rarely found on the black market in The Zone, but the problems with ammunition supply make it a questionable choice. \n \n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Reliability: %c[0,170,170,170]below average\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Durability: %c[0,170,170,170]average\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Ergonomics: %c[0,170,170,170]average %c[0,140,140,140] \n \n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] ATTACHMENTS: 9mm-caliber compatible suppressor</text>

SR-2 was developed in the late 1990s by TsNIITochMash (famous for AS and VSS rifles) on request of Russian Federal Security Service (FSB). It was meant to be a compact, concealable personal defense weapon that would be able to penetrate all kinds of soft body armor, which stopped standard 9x19mm Para and even 7.62x25mm TT rounds - similarly to western constructions like P90 or MP7. 9x21mm Gyurza cartridge is more powerful than 9x19mm Parabellum. Default load contains an armor piercing bullet with hardened steel core, which allows to penetrate body armor on distance of up to 150 meters - all this while keeping very compact size. Latest version, the SR-2M became adopted in early 2000s by FSB and various law enforcement agencies in Russia, but after successful development of armor-piercing loads for standard 9x19mm Parabellum cartridge, the 9x21mm Gyurza and SR-2M fell out of favor - weapons designed for 9x19mm AP rounds, like Vityaz SMG, are more universal, since they can also use standard 9x19mm ammunition. Mechanically, SR-2M is a pretty unique weapon, since unlike other submachine guns it is gas operated - it's action is based on SR-3M Vikhr assault rifle, but is said to be relatively reliable.

Best used on medium and long range with sniper rounds. %c[0,140,140,140]  \n \n%c[0,170,170,170]SR-25 is a semi-automatic sniper rifle developed by Knight's Armament Company and Eugene Stoner (famous for his AR-10 and AR-15 rifles). It is loosely based on Stoner's AR-10, rebuilt in its original 7.62x51mm NATO caliber. The USSOCOM took interest in the SR-25, particularly in its high magazine capacity and faster engagement time compared to bolt-action rifles. After some modifications, SOCOM adopted the SR-25 as the Mk 11 Mod 0 in May 2000, and then it was adopted by US Army as M110 SASS. Mechanically it is just like AR-10 - a gas operated firearm that uses direct gas impingement system with a rotating bolt. The rifle has a straight-line recoil design, which reduces the muzzle rise to minimum. It is less reliable than comparable designs when dirty, but the closed system very effectively seals it from the outside, which prevents any dirt and mud from preventing the internals - this means that the AR-10s are less prone to external elements than eg. AKM. SR-25 is made from the beggining as a DMR/sniper rifle. Heavy, accurized barrel is free-floating, which, together with match trigger, provides very high accuracy (for a semi-automatic rifle) at 2 MoA and less. SR-25 has flat-top receiver with rails which allow for mounting any type of optical sights. Advantages of SR-25 are higher accuracy, better ergonomics and higher reliability than most of other comparable semi-automatic sniper rifles. Thanks to free-floating barrel it's accuracy is better than that of rifles such as M21 or SVD, and the rifle itself is easy to handle, light and comfortable to shoot. Overally, the M110 is considered one of the best semi-automatic sniper rifles in the world, topped only by sniper variants of SCAR and HK417, which currently replace it in US military. SR-25 is used by multiple countries and is also well liked on civilian market, despite it's high price. In The Zone, SR-25 rifles are rare, but very sought after and considered top of the shelf weapon. Some of them came with mercenary teams who use them as designated marksman rifles together with other similar designs. \n \n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Reliability: %c[0,170,170,170]average\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Durability: %c[0,170,170,170]above average\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Ergonomics: %c[0,170,170,170]high %c[0,140,140,140] \n \n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] ATTACHMENTS: Leupold 4.5-14x50 scope (permanent), 7.62 caliber compatible suppressor (permanent)</text>

Best used on medium and long range with sniper rounds. %c[0,140,140,140]  \n \n%c[0,170,170,170]GOL-Sniper Magnum is a bolt-action sniper rifle designed by the German company Gol-Matic GmbH of Birkenau, Hessen. It is developed from Austrian Steyr SSG 69, Austrian military's service sniper rifle known for it's very high accuracy. The rifle was designed by professional German gunsmith Gottfried Prechtl, who specializes in custom Mauser rifles. Magnum caliber GOL-Sniper rifles are based on custom Magnum Mauser actions, manufactured by Prechtl, and fitted with Lothar Walther precision barrels. The bolt-action is based on Mauser M 98 Magnum system, which was introduced in the late 19th century on the Mauser Gewehr 98. Each rifle is custom made per requisitions of every customer, whether they be for tactical or sporting purposes, therefore there are many options and configurations. A Sto-Con walnut stock forms the body of the rifle which is mounted with a Lothar Walther precision barrel and Mauser bolt. The walnut stock increases the flexibility of the rifle butt and therefore reduces recoil allowing for more precision when shooting. These rifles are used by several German police units, as well as a numbers of European target and sport shooters. In The Zone, GOL rifles are seen extremely rarely, only units known are in hands of mercenaries who use them for long-range precision killing. Just like any other rifle chambered in .338 Lapua Magnum, GOL is very powerful, capable of knocking out targets in heavy body armor on ranges beyond 1000 meters. It is used to kill enemies in heavy body armor or to shoot dangerous mutants from long distance on which shooters themselves stay safe. \n \n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Reliability: %c[0,170,170,170]very high\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Durability: %c[0,170,170,170]high\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Ergonomics: %c[0,170,170,170]above average %c[0,140,140,140] \n \n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] ATTACHMENTS: 14x Leupold VX-3 4.5-14x40mm variable magnification scope (permanent)</text>

It was one of the first successful semi-automatic rifles developed and it influenced many designs in the later years. SVT-40 is a gas operated, magazine fed self-loading rifle. It uses a short piston stroke gas action located above the barrel. The gas piston has its own return string which moved back when gun was fired. It gave a quick and powerful stroke to the bolt carrier, which carried the bolt under it, providing a reliable action even in harsh environment. Gas system had 5 settings to allow user adjust to different conditions and improve reliability. SVT can be reloaded either by replacing the 10-round magazine or by using 5-round stripper clips of the Mosin-Nagant, which can be inserted with no problem after bolt is locked back. SVT-40 has an one-piece wooden stock with shorter forend and separate upper handguard. Sighting is done by a post-type front sight and tangent type open rear sights, sniper variants had a rail to attach PU telescopic sight which was almost identical to the one used on Mosin-Nagant sniper rifles. The SVT-40 was reliable and effective weapon. It was ergonomic and had lower recoil than similar weapons. German soldiers considered SVT-40 a great weapon, often picked it up as trophy and used them in fight. 1.6 million of these rifles were produced. Production was partially stopped in WWII to give priority to less effective, but cheaper Mosin rifles. SVT-40 influenced a lot of future designs, such as Gewehr 43, FN-49 and the famous FN-FAL, widely considered one of the best rifles of cold war. In The Zone, SVT rifles come from the black market, where they are sold as a substitute to more modern battle rifles. Despite it's age, the SVT-40 is still a reliable and effective rifle. It's powerful round retains energy even on higher distances and, just like other full-size rifles, when used with soft-point ammunition the SVT can be very effective vs animals and mutants.  \n \n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Reliability: %c[0,170,170,170]above average\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Durability: %c[0,170,170,170]average\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Ergonomics: %c[0,170,170,170]average %c[0,140,140,140] \n \n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] ATTACHMENTS: PU-SVT 3.5x scope</text>

It was developed by Smith and Wesson from the earlier SW Model 39 by adapting a 14-round capacity stagger-stack magazine. It was designed for the US Navy as a large-capacity version of the SW Model 39, the basis of their Mark 22 "Mark 22 Hush Puppy" silenced pistol. In 1965, the US Navy commissioned a version of the SW Model 39 that could take the 13-round magazine of the Browning Hi-Power. In early 1970, a dozen experimental all-stainless-steel prototypes were made and were issued to Navy SEAL commandos for evaluation in the field. The firearm was however not adopted, but entered civilian market instead. Three main variants of SW M59 exist, SW459 has alloy frame with blued finish, SW559 is all-steel with blued finish and SW659 has alloy frame with stainless steel finish. Mechanically, Model 59 is a recoil operated, locked breech firearm, utilizing Browning Hi-Power type locking principle and double action trigger with slide-mounted safety switch. It is considered a good and affordable medium-shelf pistol. Smith and Wesson is famous for their revolvers, but their semi-automatic pistols are also popular in the USA. In Europe, the Smith and Wesson's pistols aren't popular and are very rare to see, so also in The Zone they're very rare and stalkers usually prefer other weapons that are more familiar to them. Nonetheless, the 459 is a solid pistol and will not disappoint it's owner.\n \n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Reliability: %c[0,170,170,170]average\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Durability: %c[0,170,170,170]average\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Ergonomics: %c[0,170,170,170]average %c[0,140,140,140] \n \n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] ATTACHMENTS: 9mm caliber compatible suppressor</text>

It is available in several configurations, most notably TAR-21 (rifle, with 18" barrel) and CTAR-21 (carbine, with 15" barrel). Mechanically, TAR-21 is a gas operated, selective fire, magazine fed assault rifle of bullpup configuration. It utilizes a now-common long piston stroke, rotating bolt action (similar to AK-47), with the gas piston rigidly attached to the bolt carrier. The TAR-21 has no separate receiver. Instead, all parts are mounted within the high impact-resistant plastic housing, reinforced with steel inserts where appropriate. Early production TAR-21 rifles had no iron sights, but this has been fixed with introduction of the folded front and rear sights on current production models. Tavor rifles are fitted with the standard accessory rail on the top, which allows for any optical sight to be attached. It's long barrel allows for higher effective range and gives bullets high velocity, which means they tumble and fragment in tissue more efficiently, dealing higher damage.

Long barrel provides high velocity, resulting in high damage and range. Low recoil. Can place follow-up shots reliably and quickly. Improved bullpup construction provides very good handling. Effective at all ranges. %c[0,140,140,140]  \n \n%c[0,170,170,170]Tavor is a bullpup assault rifle chambered in 5.56x45mm NATO, developed in the late 1990s by IWI for Israeli military. It is made to be a light and maneuverable, but also reliable and rugged rifle to work well in harsh conditions of desert terrain. It is available in several configurations, most notably TAR-21 (rifle, with 18" barrel) and CTAR-21 (carbine, with 15" barrel). Mechanically, TAR-21 is a gas operated, selective fire, magazine fed assault rifle of bullpup configuration. It utilizes a now-common long piston stroke, rotating bolt action (similar to AK-47), with the gas piston rigidly attached to the bolt carrier. The TAR-21 has no separate receiver. Instead, all parts are mounted within the high impact-resistant plastic housing, reinforced with steel inserts where appropriate. Early production TAR-21 rifles had no iron sights, but this has been fixed with introduction of the folded front and rear sights on current production models. Tavor rifles are fitted with the standard accessory rail on the top, which allows for any optical sight to be attached. It's long barrel allows for higher effective range and gives bullets high velocity, which means they tumble and fragment in tissue more efficiently, dealing higher damage. The weapon is partially ambidextrous. The ejection ports are made on both sides of the weapon, and the right or the left side ejection can be selected by installing the bolt with the ejector mounted on the right or on the left, respectively. This is higher level of ambidexterity than of older bullpups, but isn't as advanced as in more modern constructions, like F2000 or RFB; unlike these constructions, the shooter can't change hands during the fight. Overally, TAR-21 is a very effective and reliable weapon. It is considered to be one of the best bullpup assault rifles. In The Zone, Tavor rifles are used by mercenaries and stalkers alike. It's available on both legal and black market, however for a high price. It's well liked for it's great handling and low weight, which is important on long trips. \n \n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Reliability: %c[0,170,170,170]high\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Durability: %c[0,170,170,170]high\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Ergonomics: %c[0,170,170,170]high %c[0,140,140,140] \n \n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] ATTACHMENTS: MARS sight (permanent), 5.56 caliber compatible suppressor</text>

Furniture included a pistol grip, detachable wooden shoulder stock and either a detachable forward grip or horizontal forearm. Sights on pre-war models included advanced sights adjustable for ranges up to 500m and windage. Since practical range was no more than 100m, wartime models (M1928A1, M1 and M1A1) used a simplified fixed aperture rear sight. Construction is complicated and required high workload, which made Thompson very expensive and unfit for a military weapon (later on it was replaced by M3 Grease Gun). Thompson was well liked for it's high firepower and controllability, but soldiers often complained about it's excessive weight at almost 5kg, which made it hard to carry on long distances. On the other hand, heavy weight and effective muzzle device reduced it's recoil, making it very easy to shoot even on longer bursts, despite it's rather powerful ammunition.

VHS-2 is improved variant of VHS rifle, differing mostly by new, more modern aesthetics and ambidexterity (first variant of VHS was only right-handed). Mechanically, VHS-2 is a gas operated, select-fire rifle with rotary bolt locking and a manual gas regulator. All controls are ambidextrous. It features dual ejection windows on both sides of the receiver, so the user can select which side to eject the spent cartridges. However, this  operation does require partial disassembly of the gun, so it is not a "true" ambidextrous weapon like F2000 or RFB, being closer to TAR-21 instead. Whole receiver is covered by housing made of strengthened polymer. VHS rifles are available either with an integrated MIL-STD-1913 (Picatinny) rail above the receiver and back-up iron sight on removable bases, or with integrated 1.5x telescopic sight. An indigenous 40mm grenade launcher can be mounted below the barrel. 16" barrel provides good muzzle velocity for 5.56mm bullet, which relies on velocity to yaw and fragment in the tissue. These rifles are compatible with most types of STANAG (M16-type) magazines. VHS-2 was thoroughly tested and is considered to be reliable and effective. It was officially adopted into Croatian military on 2009, it is also used by Albania, Bosnia, Iraq, Syria and Romania. In The Zone, VHS-2 rifles are sometimes seen on black market, where, just like all other bullpup rifles, they are well liked for their great handling and compact dimensions, which is important on long trips and expeditions. \n \n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Reliability: %c[0,170,170,170]high\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Durability: %c[0,170,170,170]high\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Ergonomics: %c[0,170,170,170]high %c[0,140,140,140] \n \n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] ATTACHMENTS: SUSAT scope, 5.56 caliber compatible suppressor</text>

Chambered in relatively weak pistol cartridge it doesn't have range or power of assault rifles, but it is by default adapted to shoot increased power 7N21 and 7N31 armor-piercing cartridges, which can reach rifle penetration levels. The Vityaz (Russian: "Knight") is a lightweight select fire weapon that uses a simple closed bolt, straight blowback method of operation. As such, it has no gas system and the internal components have been modified accordingly. The bolt carrier with integral charging handle is similar to AK, however the piston rod and rotary bolt were removed and the piston extension was plugged with a steel insert. It is chambered for the 9?19mm Parabellum pistol cartridge and will also fire the new high-pressure armor-piercing 7N31 round that can penetrate body armor as efficiently as rifle rounds. Vityaz is used by Russian MVD and law enforcment. In The Zone it is used by some Mercenary teams as a light CQB weapon together with other submachine guns like MP5 or Bizon.

It was meant to be a cheap semi-automatic pistol that could be quickly repurposed into machine pistol/PDW by adding a polymer stock to it, which allowed the burst-fire mode to be enabled. VP70 was a pretty revolutionary design back then, it had many modern features. It was the first mass-produced polymer pistol, predating the Glock by 12 years and used a spring-loaded striker, it was also one of the first modern machine pistols of that type. VP-70 is a blowback operated, striker fired, double action only pistol. In military version, VP-70M, it can be used along with detachable shoulder stock – holster, which has built in fire selector device, that allows to fire single shots or three rounds bursts. Withouth the stock attached, only single shots can be fired. Despite the simply blowback operation, not so common in 9mm Luger/Para handguns, the VP-70 had modest felt recoil, but heavy and long trigger pull does not helped to improve accuracy. It was found that in 3-round burst mode the pistol was very inaccurate and as such the VP70 didn't catch on. The production ended in 1989. Currently, some VP70 pistols can be found on black market, including arms dealers in The Zone. Despite it's low accuracy, the VP70 is a solid and effective weapon for self-defense, but most people prefer a modern polymer-frame pistol instead, like a Glock or USP.\n \n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Reliability: %c[0,170,170,170]above average\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Durability: %c[0,170,170,170]average\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Ergonomics: %c[0,170,170,170]above average %c[0,140,140,140] \n \n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] ATTACHMENTS: 9mm caliber compatible suppressor</text>

VSSK is an accurate and powerful sniper rifle with range of up to 600 meters. It is a bolt action, straight pull bullpup sniper rifle designed for special operations which require silent precision fire and ability of armor and barrier penetration superior to that of VSS Vintorez sniper rifles. Ammunition types contain a solid bronze FMJ sniper bullet, which tumbles in tissue causing heavy damage or a bullet with armor piercing core, which can penetrate up to whopping 16mm of steel on 200 meters (9x39mm penetrates 8mm of steel on half the range) or level V body armor on 100 meters. It's not as powerful as KVSK sniper rifle, which uses 12.7x108mm rounds that have twice the muzzle energy, but nonetheless it is an effective and very deadly weapon. However, it's low availability and very expensive ammunition severely limits it's use outside the agencies that have first-hand source of ammo and spare parts. Because of this, VSSK should be used only for most demanding missions. In The Zone it is used with success against enemies in heavy body armor and for killing mutants from safe distance.

This rifle entered service in Czechoslovak army in 1958 and stayed as official service rifle until 2011, when modern CZ-805 BREN rifle started replacing it. It's aesthetics are similar to those of AK rifle, but internal mechanics are completely different and no parts are interchangeable. It was a successful rifle, considered by many to be accurate and reliable and was used by more than 15 countries other than Czechoslovakia, most notably Cuba, India, Libya and Vietnam. Some numbers of these rifles are also available on the black market and reached The Zone too. The Samopal vzor 1958 ("Automatic weapon" model 1958) was the standard assault rifle of the Czechoslovak army from the late 1950s and until the separation of the CSSR in the 1993. It didn't see much of real combat, so there's not much information how it fares compared to AKM or M16, but the overall quality, fit and finish of this rifle is excellent. Sa58's development began in 1956 and the rifle was adopted for service only 2 years later, in 1958. The rifle was manufactured by the state-owned arms factory "Ceska zbrojovka", located in the town of Uhersky Brod (CZ-UB). It is now being replaced by more modern CZ-805 rifle, which is by many considered one of the best modern assault rifles. Mechanically, vz.58 is a gas operated firearm using short stroke gas piston principle - it uses Walther P38 pistol action and Czech ZB-26 machine gun locking.

It was introduced in 1964 as a low-cost replacement for the venerable Model 12. These shotguns utilize pump action, which is operated by a sliding the forend. The fore-end is located on the underside of the barrel and moves front to back. Ammunition is fed from the tubular magazine that is located under the barrel. Available versions may have a stock with or without a pistol grip. A bayonet could be attached to the front end of the barrel of the military variant of the Model 1200, it also had ventilated forend and sling swivels. Winchester 1200 has a hammerless action which means that there is no external hammer spur. There is an internal hammer which strikes the firing pin which - in turn - strikes the primer on the shell to ignite the powder in the round. The Model 1200 was the second shotgun to utilize a rotary bolt with four locking lugs secured within the barrel extension. The 1200 was Winchester's first shotgun to incorporate the company's patented Winchoke system, a quick change tube to allow the easy replacement of chokes. Overally, the Winchester 1300 is a reliable and well built pump action shotgun, even thought it didn't gain as much fame as it's rivals. Pump action shotguns are popular in both the USA and Europe, and some stalkers brought these weapons, often legally owned, along with them into The Zone, where they are primarily used for defense against wild animals and mutants or hunting them. Like all other shotguns, the Winchester 1300 is liked for the sheer power that the 12 gauge shells provide. \n \n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Reliability: %c[0,170,170,170]high\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Durability: %c[0,170,170,170]high\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Ergonomics: %c[0,170,170,170]average %c[0,140,140,140] \n \n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] ATTACHMENTS: none </text>

The AKM is a Soviet assault rifle chambered in 7.62x39mm M43 cartridge. It is a modernized variant of AK-47 rifle - the most famous firearm in the world, often called the most reliable rifle ever designed. Overengineered receiver and chrome lined barrel provide exceptional durability, and the well-designed cartridge dimensions and strong action allow for reliable feeding in almost all conditions, even when the weapon is very dirty and/or corroded. Due to it's great balance of firepower, accuracy, reliability and low price, the AK-47 is often considered the "gold standard" and a point of reference among assault rifles. It is reliable, easy to produce, easy to operate and very effective. Among it's disadvantages are it's relatively heavy weight (in comparison to more modern rifles), susceptibility to catching dirt and dust (it's not sealed from outside elements) and worse accuracy in comparison with M16 or AK-74. The AK is a gas operated, selective fire assault rifle. The gas operated action has a massive bolt carrier with a permanently attached long stroke gas piston. The bolt carrier moves on the two rails with visible clearances between the parts, which allows the gun to operate even when it's interior is severely fouled with sand or mud. Zastava M70 is a very solid AK variant and is just as good and maybe even better than original Soviet AKM. M70 rifles were first produced in the year 1970 and are still produced today. It became a service rifle of Yugoslavian People's Army and police forces and was widely exported, finding it's place all around the world, most notably in Africa and Middle East.

This heavier, more powerful cartridge makes it harder to control than AKS-74u, but there's one special characteristic of it: it loses very little of velocity when shot from shorter barrel, unlike 5.45x39mm cartridge. This means that M92 has similar range and potential damage factor as longer AK or M70 rifles, while AKS-74u is less powerful than AK-74. It's disadvantages are, as said before, higher recoil, noticeably higher mass and bigger muzzle flash. Nonetheless, in The Zone it's sometimes preferred over AKS-74u due to it's better wounding potential, especially when it comes to fighting wild animals and mutants. Zastava M92 follows the typical Kalashnikov-style design, with long stroke gas piston operation, rotary bolt locking and stamped steel receiver. It has relatively short, 254mm (10") barrel, with front sight mounted above the gas block and with the AKS-74u-style flash hider at the muzzle. Despite very short barrel it loses very little muzzle velocity compared to full-lenght AKM or M70 rifle, which means it has similar terminal ballistics like them - this is a huge advantage over AKS-74u, which loses some velocity, resulting in lower potential damage done to target's tissue. Rate of fire is same as standard M70 rifle - 620 rounds per minute, which is lower than AKS-74u, which shoots 735 rounds per minute on average. Shoulder stock is underfolding type, similar to that used in AKMS rifle.Furniture is different than in AKSu - handguard is similar as in M70, sporting three vent holes (which help with the overheating) and pistol grip is made from black polymer with specific shape similar to other Yugoslavian rifles. M92 can use all 7.62x39mm AK magazines. Overally, Zastava M92 is a good competitor to AKS-74u in The Zone. Stalker must choose if he wishes better damage or lower weight and higher rate of fire. Both these weapons have their own advantages and disadvantages and can be both a very good choice in their own niche. \n \n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Reliability: %c[0,170,170,170]high\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Durability: %c[0,170,170,170]high\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Ergonomics: %c[0,170,170,170]above average %c[0,140,140,140] \n \n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] ATTACHMENTS: 7.62mm-caliber compatible suppressor</text>

Use of new, smaller cartridge increases accuracy and range and makes it much easier to take follow up shots with it, which increases the chances of hitting - all this while retaining durability and reliability of other AK rifles. AK-74 and it's variants still stay as service rifle of Ukrainian military and is one of the most popular weapons in The Zone due to it's reliability, accuracy, low price and readily available ammunition. Mechanically, it's a gas operated, selective fire assault rifle. The gas operated action has a massive bolt carrier with a permanently attached long stroke gas piston. The bolt carrier moves on the two rails with visible clearances between the parts, which allows the gun to operate even when it's interior is severely fouled with sand or mud. Overengineered receiver and chrome lined barrel provide exceptional durability, and the well-designed cartridge dimensions and strong action allow for reliable feeding in almost all conditions, even when the weapon is very dirty and/or corroded. Among main features of AKS-74 are the chambering in lighter and more accurate 5.45x39mm round and a new muzzle device, which further reduces the recoil, muzzle climb and the flash from firing, together with new type of stock which folds to the side. Furniture is slightly redesigned from AKM, early AK-74s used plywood furniture like AKM but big amount was also produced with dark-plum coloured polymer stock and handguards, which is more resistant to wear and slightly lighter than plywood. AK-74 and it's variants stay in service in more than 20 countries. AKS-74 also still stays as service rifle of Ukrainian military and is one of the most popular weapons in The Zone due to it's reliability, accuracy, low price and readily available ammunition. Lots of these rifles were stolen from military warehouses or bought off from corrupt military officials.

TOZ-66 is one of many side-by-side (SxS) double barrel shotguns manufactured by Tulsky Oruzheiny Zavod (Russian: Tula Arms Factory) in Soviet Union. It was designed in 1968 and the production ran until late 1970s. Like all other Soviet hunting weapons, it is a simple design, without decorations or any revolutionary solutions, but is a solid piece of work and does it's job as intended, all that for unmatched price. It has a "monoblock" construction, the breech area, including the locking lugs, are machined from one piece. These shotguns were popular among hunters and civilian shooting enthusiasts and were brought to The Zone by stalkers who owned them or bought them on black market. Two barrels hold one shell each and can be fired both in the same time. One disadvantage of SxS setup is that barrels of a double-barreled shotgun are not parallel, but slightly angled, so that shots from the barrels converge, usually at about 40 meters out. For the SxS configuration, the shotstring continues on its path to the opposite side of the rib after the converging point; for example, the left barrel's discharge travels on the left of the rib till it hits dead center at 40 yards out, after that, the discharge continues on to the right. Thus, double-barreled shotguns are accurate only at practical shotgun ranges, though the range of their ammunition easily exceeds four to six times that distance. Very long barrel provides tight spread and higher muzzle velocity than typical short combat shotguns and it basically guarantees a kill on up to 75m when aimed well. However, the tight spread and it's length mean it's rather unwieldy and less effective in close quarters - some users are sawing off the barrels to make it a light and compact weapon with wider spread, nonetheless the longer barrel is definitely more effective when it comes to big game hunting.

Low magazine capacity. %c[0,140,140,140]  \n \n%c[0,170,170,170]Colt 1911 is a family of semi-automatic pistols. M1911 is chambered in .45 ACP cartridge. It was designed in 1911 for US Army by famous genius firearm designer, John M. Browning, and in 1924 the M1911A1 variant entered production. It is one of the first successful semi-automatic pistols and one of the most successful firearms ever designed - it is basically a grandfather of all modern pistols. Mechanically it's a short recoil operated firearm with SA trigger, fed from 7-round magazine by default, sporting manual and grip safety. It was a revolutionary design, as contemporary pistols were often expensive, big, heavy and awkward - it was the best pistol on the market for a long time. It became successful among soldiers, policemen and civilian gun owners alike. Today however the 1911 is a dated design - it's relatively big and heavy, and it's low capacity seriously limits it's potential as a combat weapon. Modern pistols can hold more than twice as much rounds while weighting half it's mass. The M1911 is somewhat less reliable and requires more care than modern pistols, it is nonetheless still an effective weapon, and if properly handled it can still be as deadly as one hundred years ago. Among it's strong sides are very good accuracy thanks to Single Action trigger and good susceptibility for upgrades, which can make a good match pistol out of it. Colt M1911A1 was a service pistol of US military from 1911 to 1986, when it was replaced by Beretta 92FS.

It was one of the first pistols chambered in this powerful cartridge which is basically a .357 Magnum equivalent. Mechanically it is basically just like M1911 - it's a short recoil operated firearm with SA trigger, fed from 7-round magazine by default, sporting manual and grip safety. M1911 was a revolutionary design back in the day, but in 1980s it was already overshadowed by modern designs - it didn't stand chance against new "wonder nines" like CZ-75 or Beretta 92, which were lighter, more reliable and their double-stack magazines held twice as much rounds than 1911's humble 7 rounds of .45 ACP, a round that just doesn't have enough power to justify such low capacity. Colt Delta Elite was something else however. It didn't have higher capacity than classic 1911, it however used much more powerful round - the new 10mm Auto designed by famous gun expert Jeff Cooper, which had power exceeding the famous .357 Magnum loads. New cartridge gave the aging 1911 design new life, and Colt Delta Elite is a solid choice for those who want more power than typical 9x19mm or .45ACP cartridges can give. It has gotten popular in places where being attacked by wild animals is a major danger, like Alaska, but Delta Elites also gotten famous in The Zone - their power and semi-automatic mechanism makes them a good alternative to Magnum revolvers. They are however very rare and their prices can exceed typical revolver's price range significantly.\n \n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Reliability: %c[0,170,170,170]average\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Durability: %c[0,170,170,170]high\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Ergonomics: %c[0,170,170,170]average %c[0,140,140,140] \n \n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] ATTACHMENTS: .40 or .45 caliber compatible suppressor</text>

Most powerful variant is chambered in .50 Action Express, which is about 20% more powerful than .44 Magnum (depending on the cartridge load). It's one of the most famous weapons in the world due to it's attractive look and big size, it starred in many movies and games. It is large, heavy, and uses unique gas operated action usually found in rifles, to reliably feed powerful rounds in semi-automatic mode.

Desert Eagle is large and unwieldy; it is not a good choice for concealed carry and was never adopted by any military or law enforcement agency, it is only used by sport or recreational shooters. However, due to it's powerful rounds it is sometimes carried by people living in areas where wild animals attacks occur, such as Alaska. In The Zone the wild animals and mutants activity is high, so the Desert Eagle pistols were imported and are sold on black market, where they enjoy some limited popularity.\n \n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Reliability: %c[0,170,170,170]below average\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Durability: %c[0,170,170,170]above average\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Ergonomics: %c[0,170,170,170]low </text>

The French military needed a new weapon to replace their aging MAS-49 rifles that used 7.5x54mm French cartridge which wasn't used by other NATO countries, and projects of new rifles quickly emerged. Meanwhile NATO adopted 5.56x45mm as service round and French decided to produce next prototypes in this caliber. The outcome was FAMAS F1, which, after long trials with several prototypes, was finally adopted as service rifle in 1978, replacing both MAS-49 rifle and MAT-49 submachine gun. The FAMAS was lighter, had higher capacity and was easier to use than more powerful battle rifle chambered in full-size cartridge. It's features are relatively light weight, bullpup configuration which improves handling, good sights and high rate of fire, which can be both it's advantage and disadvantage, depending on situation. Mechanically, it is quite an unique rifle, as it uses lever-delayed blowback action - system which utilizes leverage to delay the opening of the breech. The receiver is steel and the housing is made of polymer reinforced with fiberglass. First version of FAMAS, the FAMAS F1, was somewhat unreliable, as polymer parts were reported to break off and magazines deformed easily, which produced frequent jamming. Updated versions and new variant, FAMAS G2, fixed this problem almost completely, and FAMAS rifles are considered to be highly reliable. The FAMAS was official service rifle of France until 2018, when the military started replacing these weapons with German-made HK416F assault rifles. Some of FAMAS rifles were found on the black market in The Zone, where they were probably smuggled from Syria or Iraq who bought small batches of these rifles, but these informations are not yet confirmed. \n \n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Reliability: %c[0,170,170,170]above average\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Durability: %c[0,170,170,170]average\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Ergonomics: %c[0,170,170,170]above average %c[0,140,140,140] \n \n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] ATTACHMENTS: 5.56 caliber compatible suppressor</text>

Full-size cartridge gives it longer range and good accuracy, but significantly increases the recoil, making it hard to control, especially in bursts. This version is a competitor to other battle rifles of the era, like G3 or FN FAL. It's reliable and efficient, it is however much heavier than comparable rifles of this type. Galil is an Israeli rifles family which were designed by Yisrael Galil and Yaacov Lior in the late 1960s, and produced by IMI (Israel Military Industries). Israelis wanted something that could withstand desert heat, sand and continuous abuse - Six-day war of 1967 showed that FN FAL had problems in desert terrain. Captured AK-47s were found to be much better adapted to harsh, desert terrain, and Israelis decided to make their own AK variant. Finnish Rk62 was chosen - it was a weapon that was renowned for it's durability and reliability, especially in harsh conditions. Galil project won the competition for the new rifle and it's mass production started. It however never became a main weapon of Israeli infantry - it's excessive weight (about 4kg) was too much for soldiers who spend most of the time marching, and almost every one of them preferred US-supplied M16A1 rifles instead, that used same ammunition, had long and precise barrels, but also weighted a lot less (2.89kg). Galils however stayed for long time as a support weapon (with bipod) and as a weapon for rear echelon troops. Galils however became well liked in other countries, where tactics were different and where they could show their strong sides - mainly in Africa and South America. Overally, it's a very good, reliable and combat proven weapon that can be counted on.

Mechanically, StG44 is a gas operated, select-fire weapon, utilizing long-stroke piston and firing from a closed bolt. Almost all parts, except the stock, are made from metal stampings, which made StG44 much cheaper and quicker to produce than other WWII weapons.

Overally, StG44 is a very good weapon, often named by experts as one of the best infantry weapons in WWII. It was also hugely influential, as every assault rifle after 1945 comes, directly or indirectly, from StG44. During the WWII, it gave German infantry squads very high firepower compared to their enemies, often entirely armed with bolt-action rifles. Today the StG44 is somewhat obsolete, but still very effective and can definitely stand it's ground in a fight. Advantages of StG44 are high reliability, good accuracy and low recoil. It's drawbacks however are heavy weight and parts made from sheet metal stampings, which are not as durable as later designs. StG44 was primarily used by Third Reich. Almost 500 000 were produced. After the war, StG44 rifles were used by West and East Germany, Czechoslovakia, France, Poland and Yugoslavia. After the Yugoslavia's downfall, StG44 rifles reached the black market. Especially big amount reached The Zone, where Sturmgewehrs are sold for cheaper price and used by stalkers together with AK rifles in the same way. Since the 7.92mm Kurz ammo is very scarce today, Zone technicians are handloading the cartridges from spent 7.62x39 brass.

Small number of M16s were equipped with heavy barrels and telescopic sights on carry handles and called Special High Profile (there was also Low Profile variant which had carry handle removed and optics placed right on top of the receiver), they were however deemed too inaccurate (match 5.56x45mm ammo wasn't available back then) and weren't accepted into service. M16 is based on the AR-15 rifle developed by Eugene Stoner in 1960s. Mechanically, AR-15 is a gas operated firearm that uses direct gas impingement system with a rotating bolt. The rifle has a straight-line recoil design, which reduces the muzzle rise to minimum. It is less reliable than comparable designs when dirty, but the closed system very effectively seals it from the outside, which prevents any dirt and mud from preventing the internals - this means that the AR-15s are less prone to external elements than eg. AKM. in the late 1950s the AR-15 was sent to military tests, which shown that AR-15 provided up to 40% more firepower, was easier to use and - contrary to popular belief - was more reliable than M14s. In the 1963 the rifle was officially adopted as the M16. The M16 - unfairly - earned reputation of being unreliable and fragile, but these issues were mainly caused by ammunition filled with faulty powder to cut cost. After these issues were fixed in M16A1 version, the rifle worked flawlessly. "Sniper" M16A1s are extremely rare and almost never seen today. Few were seen in hands of stalkers and mercs in The Zone, it's possible they were smuggled from Southeast Asia together with other decommissioned weapons.

They also didn't have chrome plated chambers which made them very prone to corrosion. After these issues were fixed in M16A1 version, the rifle worked flawlessly. A lot of M16A1 rifles came to Europe from Philippines and Vietnam, from where they were sold to civilian market. Some of them were stolen or sold on black market, since a number of M16A1 rifles are seen in The Zone and can be bought for cheap.

M16 was based on the AR-15 design developed by Eugene Stoner in 1960s. Mechanically, AR-15 is a gas operated firearm that uses direct gas impingement system with a rotating bolt. The rifle has a straight-line recoil design, which reduces the muzzle rise to minimum. It is less reliable than comparable designs when dirty, but the closed system very effectively seals it from the outside, which prevents any dirt and mud from preventing the internals - this means that the AR-15s are less prone to external elements than eg. AKM. in the late 1950s the AR-15 was sent to military tests, which shown that AR-15 provided up to 40% more firepower, was easier to use and - contrary to popular belief - was more reliable than M14s. In 1982 M16A1 was replaced by updated variant, the M16A2. Modifications were extensive, among them were new, faster rifling (1:7") for use with heavier SS109 round, a heavier barrel to resist bending and reduce overheating in sustained fire, an adjustable rear sight, with settings adapted for new heavy bullet, to allow sighting-in without the use of special tools or a cartridge. The new A2 flash hider was closed at the bottom to prevent dirt being kicked up when fired prone. The A1's full auto setting was replaced with a three round burst setting. Overally, M16A2 has higher reliability and has stronger construction, as well as improved accuracy. It was however criticized for weight increase and the lack of full-auto mode. High amount of M16A2 rifles were sold or given as military aid to a lot of US allies; some of them were stolen or captured and reached the black market in many places of the world, including The Zone. Stalkers are sometimes distrustful when it comes to these weapons, but M16 variants are nonetheless well liked for their comfortable ergonomics and accuracy, which are much higher than those of old AK rifles. \n \n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Reliability: %c[0,170,170,170]average\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Durability: %c[0,170,170,170]above average\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Ergonomics: %c[0,170,170,170]high %c[0,140,140,140] \n \n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] ATTACHMENTS:5.56 caliber compatible suppressor</text>

It had improved accuracy, heavier barrel and more durable construction than A1 and the full-auto mode was ditched for 3-round burst mode. The rifle was then updated with a removable carrying handle and a full length quad Picatinny rail for mounting optics and other ancillary devices - this weapon received the name of M16A4. It is the latest and most modern variant of M16 rifle. While the main weapon of US infantry is the short and light M4A1, the long M16A4 has a number of advantages; most notably higher accuracy and velocity on range - since 5.56mm bullet requires higher velocity to fragment, the 20" barrel of M16A4 provides high lethality of bullet on twice the range of M4A1. Some of these rifles were sold on black market in the Middle East, from where they reached The Zone, where they can be sometimes seen, albeit very rarely.

It is based on the AR-15, an American 5.56x45mm assault rifle developed by Eugene Stoner in 1960s.

AKM. The history of M4 started together with M16, when it's carbine variants, called CAR-15, was developed. M4 received a slightly longer 14.5" barrel (CAR-15s typically had 10-11") that provides acceptable velocity and range and also allows for mounting bayonet and grenade launcher. M4A1 differs from M4 mainly by having fully-automatic fire mode (M4 had only 3-round burst mode). Because the shorter M4A1 was lighter and more maneuverable in the fight, in the end it became the service rifle of US military and almost completely replaced M16A2 and M16A4. M4A1 is praised for it's high accuracy, light weight and exceptionally good ergonomics, but is also criticized for it's relatively low reliability compared to other modern rifles and unsatisfactory terminal ballistics because of reduced muzzle velocity compared to M16. M4A1 received many upgrades throughout it's service, mostly parts replacement that improve reliability. M4A1 carbines were adopted by more than 60 countries. Some of them were stolen or captured and reached the black market in many places of the world, including The Zone. Stalkers are sometimes distrustful when it comes to these weapons, since most of M4A1s on black market are old variants which are much less reliable than modernized M4A1s of US military, but these rifles are nonetheless well liked for their comfortable ergonomics and accuracy, which are much higher than those of old AK rifles. \n \n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Reliability: %c[0,170,170,170]average\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Durability: %c[0,170,170,170]average\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Ergonomics: %c[0,170,170,170]high %c[0,140,140,140] \n \n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] ATTACHMENTS: ACOG scope, 5.56 caliber compatible suppressor</text>

M4A1 differs from M4 mainly by having fully-automatic fire mode (M4 had only 3-round burst mode). Because the shorter M4A1 was lighter and more maneuverable in the fight, in the end it became the service rifle of US military and almost completely replaced M16A2 and M16A4. M4A1 is praised for it's high accuracy, light weight and exceptionally good ergonomics, but is also criticized for it's relatively low reliability compared to other modern rifles and unsatisfactory terminal ballistics because of reduced muzzle velocity compared to M16. M4A1 received many upgrades throughout it's service, mostly parts replacement that improve reliability. M4A1 carbines were adopted by more than 60 countries. Some of them were stolen or captured and reached the black market in many places of the world, including The Zone. Stalkers are sometimes distrustful when it comes to these weapons, since most of M4A1s on black market are old variants which are much less reliable than modernized M4A1s of US military, but these rifles are nonetheless well liked for their comfortable ergonomics and accuracy, which are much higher than those of old AK rifles. \n \n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Reliability: %c[0,170,170,170]average\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Durability: %c[0,170,170,170]average\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Ergonomics: %c[0,170,170,170]high %c[0,140,140,140] \n \n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] ATTACHMENTS: EOTech 552 holographic sight (permanent), 5.56 caliber compatible suppressor</text>

All CAR-15s are based on military variant of the AR-15, which is an American 5.56x45mm assault rifle developed by Eugene Stoner in 1960s and adopted into military as M16. Mechanically, AR-15 is a gas operated firearm that uses direct gas impingement system with a rotating bolt. The rifle has a straight-line recoil design, which reduces the muzzle rise to minimum. It is less reliable than comparable designs when dirty, but the closed system very effectively seals it from the outside, which prevents any dirt and mud from preventing the internals - this means that the AR-15s are less prone to external elements than eg. AKM. During the Vietnam War, Colt made several short barreled carbines that were fielded. First of them was the Colt Model 607 with 10" barrel, which was adopted in 1966 and received the name XM177 (later replaced by XM177E1, which was based on Colt 609 and looked similar to M4). All Colt Commando carbines have short barrels which improve their maneuverability, but radically limits the muzzle velocity. Small and light 5.56mm bullet deals damage by fragmenting and yawing in the tissue, but it requires a certain velocity to do so and 10" barrel provides it only at the muzzle. Beyond point-blank range the bullet might not work properly and produce only "ice pick" wounds, as in, passes straight through without doing much damage - if it doesn't hit vital organs straight away, it will not disable the target and multiple hits might be needed. However, their compact size was a big enough advantage for these rifles to become favorites of special forces. A small batch of these weapons reached black market in The Zone, probably coming from Vietnam or Philippines. Just like other carbines, are very well liked for their compact size by scavengers who need to carry a lot of loot and a big rifle encumbers them too much. \n \n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Reliability: %c[0,170,170,170]average\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Durability: %c[0,170,170,170]average\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Ergonomics: %c[0,170,170,170]high %c[0,140,140,140] \n \n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] ATTACHMENTS:5.56 caliber compatible suppressor</text>

The Mk18 is basically an M4A1 carbine outfitted with Close Quarter Battle Receiver (CQBR) - a replacement upper receiver featuring a barrel of 10.3" (262mm) in length. The shorter barrel makes the weapon significantly more compact, which makes it easier to use in and around vehicles and in tight confined spaces. Special units such as commandos boarding ships have found such shortened weapons very useful and use them very often. The Mk18 is an AR-15 variant. Mechanically, AR-15 is a gas operated firearm that uses direct gas impingement system with a rotating bolt. The rifle has a straight-line recoil design, which reduces the muzzle rise to minimum. It is less reliable than comparable designs when dirty, but the closed system very effectively seals it from the outside, which prevents any dirt and mud from preventing the internals - this means that the AR-15s are less prone to external elements than eg. AKM. Mk18 is praised for it's light weight and short dimensions, which make it very easy to handle. It has it's drawbacks, however. The short barrel doesn't provide enough muzzle velocity for the bullet - small and light 5.56mm bullet deals damage by fragmenting and yawing in the tissue, but it requires a certain velocity to do so and Mk18 provides it only at the muzzle. Beyond point-blank range the bullet might not work properly and produces only "ice pick" wounds, as in, passes straight through without doing much damage - if it doesn't hit vital organs straight away, it will not disable the target and multiple hits might be needed. Because of this, US special forces use special dedicated frangible 5.56mm ammunition that deforms easily even at slower speeds. Without this ammunition however Mk18's terminal ballistics are rather disappointing. Nonetheless, the Mk18 is a very good weapon in it's niche and while it lacks universality of 14"-20"-barreled rifles it will not let it's user down in the situations it was designed for. \n \n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Reliability: %c[0,170,170,170]average\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Durability: %c[0,170,170,170]average\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Ergonomics: %c[0,170,170,170]very high %c[0,140,140,140] \n \n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] ATTACHMENTS: SPECTRE 4x (permanent), 5.56 caliber compatible suppressor</text>

Best on medium range. %c[0,140,140,140]  \n \n%c[0,170,170,170]The M27 Infantry Automatic Rifle is a lightweight automatic weapon based on the HK416 rifle designed to fulfill role of automatic rifleman's weapon. The M27 is meant to provide more precise suppression than M249 for the cost of lower volume of fire. At first it was intended to only replace SAWs in USMC, but later on it was chosen as a service weapon, replacing the M4A1 and M16A4. The M27 IAR was adopted as the standard issue service rifle of the Marine Corps infantry in 2018. The M27 is basically HK416 with heavy barrel, other differences are minor. HK416 is a 5.56x45mm assault rifle developed in Germany by Heckler and Koch. It is based on AR-15 rifle, sharing the aesthetics and ergonomics with it, but it uses a gas piston system (used before in G36) which greatly increases the weapon's reliability. HK416 system uses a short-stroke piston that forces the bolt carrier to the rear; this design prevents combustion gases from entering the weapon's interior — a drawback of direct impingement systems which reduces weapon's reliability and parts life. The HK416 is considered by many to be one of the best assault rifles of modern times - it is light, reliable, ergonomic and can be customized to fit operator's needs. M27's heavy barrel further increase the durability of weapon as it overheats slower, which increases the potential barrel life. Free-floating barrel provides exceptional accuracy up to 2MOA, which makes M27 fit for precise long range shooting - the M27 with high-power optics mounted were adopted as M38 Designated Marksman Rifle. M27s so far aren't used outside US Marine Corps and PMC companies who receive them on special conditions. Some mercenary teams in The Zone who are operating with Ukrainian government permit are using these weapons in small numbers during their operations, which started speculations about US government participation. However, since observers from most western countries, including US, are present in the cordon outposts, it is possible that these mercenaries simply bought or stole these rifles from US soldiers who were there only on security operation. \n \n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Reliability: %c[0,170,170,170]high\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Durability: %c[0,170,170,170]high\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Ergonomics: %c[0,170,170,170]high %c[0,140,140,140] \n \n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] ATTACHMENTS: ACOG scope, 5.56 caliber compatible suppressor</text>

The name Mini-14 was chosen because the weapon is similar to M14 rifle, but is chambered in smaller cartridge. Mechanically, Ruger Mini-14 is a gas operated, semi-automatic only weapon which uses Garand-type rotary bolt with two lugs. Action is operated by the long-stroke gas piston, which is located below the barrel and is concealed within forend of the stock. Manual safety is also patterned after M1 rifle, and is located at the front of the trigger guard. Standard stock of the Mini-14 is of single-piece type, with semi-pistol grip and separate heatshield above the barrel. Early Mini-14 rifles had wooden heatshileds which exposed operating rod; current production civilian guns feature polymer heatshields which cover most of the operating rod. Standard sights consist of a blade-type front and adjustable diopter-type rear sight; "Ranch" type rifles also had integral scope mounts on the receiver, which will accept proprietary Ruger scope rings. Overally, the Mini-14 is a relatively simple and cost-effective rifle and gained relatively high popularity in the USA, where for a long time it was a cheaper alternative to AR-15 rifles, however, after AR-15s became more popular and their prices dropped, Mini-14 sales diminished. Mini-14 has it's drawbacks compared to AR-15. It's "classic" stock design means it has higher recoil and muzzle rise, ergonomy is also worse than in AR-15. Some users were also critical of weapons' quality and design's reliability in difficult conditions. The rifle also never became popular in Europe, and are relatively rare on the black market; because of this, they're only very rarely seen in The Zone, where they're used as an alternative to military designs like AR-15 or AK-74.\n \n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Reliability: %c[0,170,170,170]average\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Durability: %c[0,170,170,170]average\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Ergonomics: %c[0,170,170,170]above average %c[0,140,140,140] \n \n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] ATTACHMENTS: 5.56 caliber compatible suppressor</text>

During World War II, the US Army was under great impression of German MG34 and MG42 machine guns. After the war ended, US decided to copy both the German doctrine of light machine gun as a primary source of firepower of the squad, but also the weapon itself. Americans used solutions from MG42 and FG42 (paratrooper battle rifle) and put them together. The outcome was the M60 - gas-operated, air-cooled, belt-fed machine gun that fires from the open-bolt. All parts are made from stamped sheet metal for cheap and easy manufacture. One of the M60's unique features is that it was designed to be easy and effective while shooting from the shoulder or from the hip. Slow rate of fire and specially designed gas system reduce the recoil, and the polymer handguard - a feature often overlooked even in more modern LMGs - allows for relatively comfortable holding without the risk of burning one's hand from the heated receiver after prolonged fire. M60 was praised for it's controllability, light weight and high firepower, but was heavily criticized for unsatisfactory reliability and durability. It also had design flaws, for example lack of quick-change barrel or inseparability of the barrel from the gas system regulator and the bipod. Especially it's durability was the main reason the M60 was withdrawn from service. Old M60s in US service often jammed, the parts were breaking or separating and falling out. Newer variants fixed these issues, but not entirely. Old M60s were sold or sent to many countries as military aid. Currently a number of these machine guns are available on the black market, including the arms dealers in The Zone. These old M60s are not well liked due to it's low reliability in harsh conditions of anomalous zones, but are valued for their ability of effective shooting from the shoulder. They are sometimes used by mutant hunters squad, as they can bring high firepower without need to deploy and can bring mutants down quickly. \n \n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Reliability: %c[0,170,170,170]average\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Durability: %c[0,170,170,170]below average\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Ergonomics: %c[0,170,170,170]low </text>

It's one of the most powerful rifles used by militaries for anti-materiel and sniper duty. In early 1980s Ronnie Barrett started works on his rifle inspired by use of .50cal heavy machine guns for long-range shooting in Vietnam - famous sniper Carlos Hathcock set a world record for long range kill with M2 HMG. The M82 was a success and, under the name M107, it is used as an anti-materiel rifle for destroying unexploded ordnance, radios, antennas, vehicle engines or fuel tanks. .50 caliber bullet can pierce thick walls, metal plates and go through vehicle engine block while retaining enough energy to remain lethal, making it a perfect weapon for stopping vehicles and killing enemies behind heavy cover or in heavy body armor. The Barret M82 is a recoil operated, short barrel stroke, semi-automatic firearm. The receiver consists of two parts made from stamped sheet metal, connected by cross-pins. Heavy barrel is fluted to improve heat dissipation and save weight, and fitted with large and effective reactive muzzle brake. M82A1 rifles are fitted with a bipod, scope mount and a folding backup iron sights. Picatinny rail on receiver allows for using any type of optical sight; military standard is usually Leupold M-series 10x scope. The Barrett M82 is an effective weapon that was a revolutionary design which started the era of .50cal sniper rifles - after it's success a lot of new anti-materiel weapons and high caliber sniper rifles emerged. It is large and heavy, but it's expected with weapon of this type. It's real drawbacks are less than perfect reliability and the unsatisfactory accuracy at about 3MOA (similar to M16A4 rifle) which doesn't let it use full potential of .50 caliber bullet on ranges above 800m (however, it was never intended to be a "true" sniper rifle). Instead, sniper teams tend to use dedicated .50 caliber sniper rifles, like MacMillan TAC-50, while the M82 is used against enemies behind cover or in vehicles on more typical engagement ranges. M82 can be bought on civilian market with right permit and some stalkers smuggled these rifles to The Zone for use as high-power hunting weapons. Just like all other high-bore rifles, the M82 excels at engaging big mutants from the long range, where the shooter remains safe. \n \n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Reliability: %c[0,170,170,170]above average\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Durability: %c[0,170,170,170]average\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Ergonomics: %c[0,170,170,170]very low %c[0,140,140,140] \n \n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] ATTACHMENTS: Leupold Mark 4 4.5-14x variable magnif. scope, .50 caliber reticle (permanent)</text>

It is classified as Squad Automatic Weapon - a subcategory of light machine guns chambered in intermediate cartridge, similar to Soviet RPD light machine gun. It's production began in 1982 and it became an instant hit, being adopted by more than 75 countries, most notably Australia, Great Britain, Italy and USA, which adopted it as M249 SAW. Mechanically, Minimi is an air cooled, gas operated, belt fed automatic weapon. It uses a conventional gas action with the gas piston located below the barrel, and the barrel is locked using the traditional rotary bolt. Open bolt reduces the overheating and allows for prolonged fire. The barrel is quick-detachable, with carrying handle to aid in barrel change procedure. Minimi can be fed using ammunition belts or AR-15 magazines, however, the magazine feeding is only for emergency situations as stoppages commonly occur when using it. Belts are fed from special 200 round plastic boxes that can be clipped beneath the receiver. The Minimi's biggest advantages are high rate of fire and very good controllability with minimal recoil, which make it very easy to provide suppressing fire with, without the need to deploy it on the bipod. High rate of fire allows to send a lot of lead down range in short duration. It is also very compact compared to typical light machine guns, which improves the maneuverability and handling. The Minimi however is relatively heavy at 7.5kg (RPK-74 weights 4.7kg), however it's still lighter than M60 or M240 LMGs. Another drawback is it's accuracy, which is lower than that of typical assault rifles chambered in the same 5.56x45mm caliber. Minimi was also criticized for unsatisfactory reliability, however, most of the problems with it in US military are from the old age of these guns which were heavily used and not properly maintenanced. In The Zone, Minimis can be sometimes (albeit rarely) seen on black market, coming from withdrawn military surplus, which then reached the black market. Some PMC mercenary groups also use Minimis and M249s for extra firepower, especially for expeditions in the areas with high mutant activity. \n \n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Reliability: %c[0,170,170,170]above average\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Durability: %c[0,170,170,170]average\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Ergonomics: %c[0,170,170,170]below average </text>

It was adopted in 1891 into the Tsarist armed forces of Russian Empire and stayed as the service rifle of Soviet Union until early 1950s, when it started to be gradually replaced by SKS carbines and, later, the famous AK assault rifles. However, the Mosin rifle still is used by multiple countries, mostly as a cheap sniper rifle, and is popular among civilians as target and hunting rifle. The Mosin is a manually operated, bolt-action rifle fed from internal, non-removable magazine holding 5 rounds. The magazine is loaded from top via clips or single rounds. The receiver is made of steel and is covered by wooden stock on whole length. The bolt of the rifle is of rather crude construction. It's biggest strength is it's durability and reliability. The construction has big tolerances which allows the user to operate the rifle reliably even when it is dirty or frozen. It's biggest drawback is the bolt, which requires relatively high amount of strength to operate it, which limits the speed with which it can be operated and in effect reduces the practical rate of fire. Mosin's accuracy is, contrary to popular belief, on par with other WWII bolt-action rifles. More than 40 millions of these rifles were produced. They remains on battlefields up to this day, often seen in Middle East, Asia, Africa and, lately, in the Ukraine. In The Zone the Mosin rifles are available for very cheap in huge amounts from both the civilian stocks or black market. Mosins are often used as hunting rifles, so some stalkers bring their own Mosins to The Zone with them. They are used there as hunting weapons or cheap sniper rifles, either using original sniper variants with factory-mounted scopes or field modifications with scope mounts welded on by technicians. \n \n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Reliability: %c[0,170,170,170]very high\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Durability: %c[0,170,170,170]high\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Ergonomics: %c[0,170,170,170]average %c[0,140,140,140] \n \n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] ATTACHMENTS: welded-on scope mount, 4x fixed magnification hunting scope (permanent)</text>

Revolutionaries, various irregular forces and common criminals cut down the Mosin–Nagant rifles to pistol size for easy concealment. This practice was born during the Revolution, but sawn-off Mosins were also popular among partizans and others who needed a compact and concealable weapon yet couldn't get themselves a pistol or a compact submachine gun. The Mosin M1891/30 rifle, officially called the "three-line rifle of 1891 pattern", is a Russian bolt-action rifle chambered in 7.62x54mmR.

In The Zone the Mosin rifles are available for very cheap in huge amounts from both the civilian stocks or black market. Since Mosin rifles are extremely cheap, they can be sawn-off to get cheapest possible compact weapon. In The Zone, Obrez are rarely made and used as last-ditch protection against wild animals and mutants. Powerful 7.62x54mmR cartridge has significant power, however, from such a short barrel the velocity loss is very high and the bullet doesn't have enough time to gain speed and accuracy. It is called a "budget hand cannon" for it's extreme recoil and muzzle flash. \n \n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Reliability: %c[0,170,170,170]very high\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Durability: %c[0,170,170,170]high\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Ergonomics: %c[0,170,170,170]above average %c[0,140,140,140] \n \n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] ATTACHMENTS: none</text>

Moderate damage output. Best on medium range. %c[0,140,140,140]  \n \n%c[0,170,170,170]AKS-74 is a folding-stock variant of AK-74, a Soviet 5.45x39mm assault rifle that was designed in early 1970s as an answer to new US M16 rifle shooting new type of ammunition. Use of new, smaller cartridge increases accuracy and range and makes it much easier to take follow up shots with it, which increases the chances of hitting - all this while retaining durability and reliability of other AK rifles. AK-74 and it's variants still stay as service rifle of Ukrainian military and is one of the most popular weapons in The Zone due to it's reliability, accuracy, low price and readily available ammunition. Mechanically, it's a gas operated, selective fire assault rifle. The gas operated action has a massive bolt carrier with a permanently attached long stroke gas piston. The bolt carrier moves on the two rails with visible clearances between the parts, which allows the gun to operate even when it's interior is severely fouled with sand or mud. Overengineered receiver and chrome lined barrel provide exceptional durability, and the well-designed cartridge dimensions and strong action allow for reliable feeding in almost all conditions, even when the weapon is very dirty and/or corroded. Among main features of AKS-74 are the chambering in lighter and more accurate 5.45x39mm round and a new muzzle device, which further reduces the recoil, muzzle climb and the flash from firing, together with new type of stock which folds to the side. Furniture is slightly redesigned from AKM, early AK-74s used plywood furniture like AKM but big amount was also produced with dark-plum coloured polymer stock and handguards, which is more resistant to wear and slightly lighter than plywood. AK-74 and it's variants stay in service in more than 20 countries. AKS-74 also still stays as service rifle of Ukrainian military and is one of the most popular weapons in The Zone due to it's reliability, accuracy, low price and readily available ammunition. Lots of these rifles were stolen from military warehouses or bought off from corrupt military officials. Stalkers like AKS-74's folding stock as it is more compact, making it easier to carry. \n \n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Reliability: %c[0,170,170,170]very high\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Durability: %c[0,170,170,170]high\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Ergonomics: %c[0,170,170,170]average %c[0,140,140,140] \n \n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] ATTACHMENTS: EKP-1S-03 Kobra red dot sight (permanent), GP-25 grenade launcher, 5.45 caliber compatible suppressor</text>

Works on the FAL began as early as in 1946 and in 1953 the FAL as it is known today was first produced. In 1956 it was adopted by Belgian Army, and almost at the same time the new rifle was adopted by UK, Austria, Canada, Australia, Argentina, Brazil and many more countries. Mechanically, FN FAL is a gas-operated firearm using a short-stroke gas piston system with tilting breechblock. The receiver is all steel with polymer furniture (L1A1 variant used by UK used wooden furniture). Adjustable and effective gas system reduces the recoil and makes FAL much more controllable than other battle rifles chambered in full-size cartridges (still, it is not advised to shoot it in bursts). It was produced in many variants and a lot of countries produced their own modernized versions. The FAL was used in many conflicts, including those with communist regimes (most notably Vietnam and Rhodesia), which got it a name "Right Arm of the Free World". It is regarded as effective, reliable and very durable rifle. It's disadvantage is a heavy, hard-hitting cartridge which makes it less universal as service rifle.

Should be used with single, well placed shots. High damage per shot. Best on medium and long range. %c[0,140,140,140]  \n \n%c[0,170,170,170]FAL is a 7.62x51mm battle rifle designed and manufactured in Belgium by FN. It is one of the most famous firearms of XX century, having been in service with more than 90(!) countries, which makes it almost as widespread as Soviet AK rifle. Works on the FAL began as early as in 1946 and in 1953 the FAL as it is known today was first produced. In 1956 it was adopted by Belgian Army, and almost at the same time the new rifle was adopted by UK, Austria, Canada, Australia, Argentina, Brazil and many more countries. Mechanically, FN FAL is a gas-operated firearm using a short-stroke gas piston system with tilting breechblock. The receiver is all steel with polymer furniture (L1A1 variant used by UK used wooden furniture). Adjustable and effective gas system reduces the recoil and makes FAL much more controllable than other battle rifles chambered in full-size cartridges (still, it is not advised to shoot it in bursts). It was produced in many variants and a lot of countries produced their own modernized versions. The FAL was used in many conflicts, including those with communist regimes (most notably Vietnam and Rhodesia), which got it a name "Right Arm of the Free World". It is regarded as effective, reliable and very durable rifle. It's disadvantage is a heavy, hard-hitting cartridge which makes it less universal as service rifle. It was finally replaced by more modern rifles chambered in 5.56x45mm NATO round, which is lighter and allows for higher volume of fire for the cost of range and power. FAL however still has it's niche and is used alongside newer assault rifles. Brazilian law enforcement and counter-terrorist units field it very often because of high-powered cartridge that provides very high wall penetration, which is important in firefights in favelas. Relatively high amount of FALs reached The Zone, where they are highly valued just like other battle rifles - their powerful round is desirable there due to it's higher effectiveness vs wild animals and mutants. \n \n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Reliability: %c[0,170,170,170]high\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Durability: %c[0,170,170,170]high\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Ergonomics: %c[0,170,170,170]average %c[0,140,140,140] \n \n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] ATTACHMENTS: SUSAT scope, 7.62mm caliber compatible suppressor</text>

Can place follow-up shots reliably and quickly. Accurized barrel and high-power optic mounted. Best used on medium and long range with sniper rounds. %c[0,140,140,140]  \n \n%c[0,170,170,170]FS2000 is a semi-automatic variant of F2000, a modern assault rifle chambered in 5.56x45mm cartridge designed and manufactured in Belgium by FN. It is an advanced, modular weapon system that consists of a bullpup assault rifle and a grenade launcher with optoelectronic fire control system. Mechanically the F2000 is a gas operated firearm with short stroke piston and rotating bolt, using tappet system similarly to Steyr AUG, with which it has a lot in common. It has a steel receiver enclosed in reinforced polymer housing of compact layout, which seals the internals from any and all external elements, like dust, mud and sand, which makes the weapon very resistant to hard environment. The weapon has 16" barrel but is very compact and easy to handle due to efficient bullpup construction. One of the most outstanding features of F2000 is a unique ejection system, which ejects spent brass forward through a tube running above the barrel. This makes the rifle completely ambidextrous, making it a great choice for both right- and left-handed shooters, and also allows the operator to switch hands during engagements (for example when leaning to the side). The ejection system is actually very simple and is not possible to clog or damage, so it doesn't reduce the weapon's reliability. F2000 is easy to field strip and dismounts into only four parts. Standard variant is equipped with 1.6x telescopic sight in polymer housing, which gives it futuristic look. F2000 was adopted by some elite special forces units and also became service rifle of the Slovenian Army. It was used in various armed conflicts, where it proven itself as a reliable and effective weapon. FN also made a civilian variant - FS2000, which fires only in semi-automatic mode. This FS2000 was fitted with heavy barrel, match trigger and hunting scope in order to make it effective on long range shooting. \n \n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Reliability: %c[0,170,170,170]high\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Durability: %c[0,170,170,170]high\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Ergonomics: %c[0,170,170,170]very high %c[0,140,140,140] \n \n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] ATTACHMENTS: 9x40 hunting scope (permanent), 5.56 caliber compatible suppressor</text>

Like 9A-91, it's made from steel stampings and it's construction is extremely simplified. It's distinctive feature is it's fixed skeletonized stock, similar to the one used in VSS Vintorez, but made entirely out of black polymer. It has scope rail and threaded barrel for attaching suppressor mounted by default - it is meant to be used as a marksman weapon with scope and silencer. It provides higher level of accuracy than 9A-91 rifle, but it is still not a rival for VSS when it comes to precision. Internally it's the same weapon as 9A-91. It's a gas operated firearm which utilizes a long stroke gas piston, located above the barrel, and a rotating bolt, just like Val. It's mostly used by Russian government agencies, but also military. Some VSK-94 rifles were also sold to Russia's allies, lately also Syria, where it's used by loyalist forces.

SKS started to become withdrawn in mid-1950s, shortly after it's adoption, as AK was better in almost every aspect. SKS carbines that were already produced were given to rear echelon troops and border guards, and  the rest were sent to ally states of USSR, amongst them East Germany, China, North Korea and, most notably, the North Vietnam, where SKS rifles were deployed en masse and for the long time were the primary weapon of Vietnamese soldiers and guerilla fighters. Overally, the gun was a solid and successful design, it just came too late and couldn't rival the Kalashnikov's assault rifle design as a military weapon. It has way lower firepower than AK since it's practical rate of fire is limited by the non-removable magazine (it must be reloaded from stripper clips) and it can only fire in semi-automatic mode, but it has up to 50% higher accuracy compared to AK which makes it slightly more effective on distances above 200 meters. Mechanically, the SKS is a gas operated firearm with a short-stroke gas piston action, using basically the same principle as the PTRS-41 anti-tank rifle action - also the design of Sergei Simonov.

It was developed as a successor to Gew41(W) rifle, which was relatively unreliable. After the Wehrmacht invaded USSR, they captured SVT-40 semi-automatic rifle, which used excellent short-stroke piston gas system that worked flawlessly. Walther company copied this system and incorporated it into their design, creating the Gewehr 43 rifle. It is a steel-receiver semi-automatic rifle with wooden furniture, fed from a removable 10-round magazine, with manufacturing process simplified for mass production - while the rifle quality was held to highest standards, the parts are crudely finished and don't look as refined as pre-war Kar98k rifles. Every rifle has a scope rail, which allows for quick attachment of ZF-4 4x sniper scope (the plans for G43 featured adding one soldier with scoped rifle to every infantry squad of 12 soldiers, similarly to modern Designated Marksman tactic, but these plans never came into life). The G43 was a very effective weapon that worked reliably in the field, was very effective and well liked by soldiers. While it's accuracy is lower than that of bolt action Kar98k rifles, which means it's not as good as sniper weapon, it added much needed firepower to infantry squad, and it's precision was good enough for typical engagement ranges for use with 4x scope. After the war, these rifles were captured by Soviets and were sent to Middle East and Asia, while some were hidden by partisans in Eastern Europe. Probably this is the source of them in Ukraine, since they were in rare cases seen in The Zone in hands of stalkers, who use them as marksman rifles on long ranges where AKs don't do well.

Made from high-grade steel, it is available in a stainless steel finish. Revolver is a repeating handgun that is fed from a revolving cylinder containing multiple chambers. Since the cylinder doesn't rely on gas or blowback for the cycling, it will cycle with each trigger pull, even if misfire occured - because of this, revolvers are usually considered much more reliable than semi-automatic pistols. They however have very complicated internals and are expensive to manufacture. The Redhawk is reinforced to handle extra stress of high-pressure loads, making it very popular for use by handloaders as it is able to handle the most powerful .45 Colt and .44 Magnum loads easily. In addition, the cylinder itself is longer than most competitors', allowing ammunition to be loaded to a longer overall length. This allows for either increased powder capacity, heavier (and therefore longer) bullets without compromising the powder load, or a combination of both. Custom ammunition manufacturers even have loads made specifically for Ruger revolvers that cannot fit in shorter chambers or revolvers of weaker construction (such as the Smith and Wesson Model 29). This makes the Redhawk a good choice as a bear defense gun among hunters and trappers. .44 Magnum revolvers, together with Redhawk, are a popular sidearm in areas with high activity of wild animals, such as Alaska or Ukrainian Exclusion Zone.\n \n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Reliability: %c[0,170,170,170]very high\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Durability: %c[0,170,170,170]very high\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Ergonomics: %c[0,170,170,170]average</text>

Improved accuracy. %c[0,140,140,140]  \n \n%c[0,170,170,170]Mateba 6 Unica is a recoil operated semi-automatic revolver, one of only a few of this type ever produced. It was developed by Mateba company from Italy. The Mateba Model 6 uses the recoil from firing to rotate the cylinder and cock the hammer, unlike conventional revolvers, which depend on the user physically pulling the trigger and/or cocking the hammer to actuate the weapon's mechanism of operation. The Mateba Autorevolver's barrel alignment is different from most other revolvers. The barrel is aligned with the bottom of the cylinder instead of the top. This lowers the bore axis (line of the barrel) which directs the recoil in line with the shooter's hand thereby reducing the twisting motion or muzzle flip of normal revolvers. The gun's entire upper assembly (barrel, cylinder and frame) are mounted on rails on the lower frame, which houses the trigger, hammer, and grip, and recoils on firing. The rearward motion of the upper assembly cocks the hammer, and the cylinder is rotated on the forward stroke. This unique action makes this revolver a semi automatic weapon, making it one of the very few semi automatic revolver designs. This innovative design has it's drawbacks, however. Since the cylinder cycles on gas action, the Autorevolver loses one of revolvers' advantage which is the cylinder cycling anyway, even on misfire - in Unica the cylinder will jam, which means it is not more reliable than semi-automatic pistols. This means that Unica has disadvantages of both revolvers and pistols while not gaining much advantages, which limits it's usefulness, however, the low bore axis makes it a pretty accurate weapon. Since it uses powerful .44 Magnum cartridges, it can be used as an effective hunting handgun.\n \n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Reliability: %c[0,170,170,170]above average\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Durability: %c[0,170,170,170]above average\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Ergonomics: %c[0,170,170,170]above average</text>

Taurus promotes the Judge as a self-defense tool against carjacking and for home protection. Mechanically it is a standard revolver - a repeating handgun that is fed from a revolving cylinder containing multiple chambers. Since the cylinder doesn't rely on gas or blowback for the cycling, it will cycle with each trigger pull, even if misfire occured - because of this, revolvers are usually considered much more reliable than semi-automatic pistols. The rifling of Judge's barrel is shallower than normal, giving bullets less stabilization than in typical handguns, but also reducing the rapid dispersion of the shot from shot shells. The Judge is a controversial weapon of niche usefulness. The shot shell discharged from short barrel provides very high power in point-blank ranges, but rapidly loses effectiveness past even as little as few meters. It is sometimes used as a sidearm similarly to large-bore Magnum revolvers in areas with risk of attacks by wild animals, such as bears. It is also very rarely used by mutant hunters in The Zone as a defensive weapon, however it's disappointing range and relatively high price results in many preferring a sawn-off shotgun instead. The Judge's advantage is five rounds in the cylinder and higher compactness. Whether it is worth it or not depends on situation and purpose.\n \n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Reliability: %c[0,170,170,170]high\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Durability: %c[0,170,170,170]average\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Ergonomics: %c[0,170,170,170]below average</text>

Very high reliability - the cylinder doesn't jam unless seriously damaged. %c[0,140,140,140]  \n \n%c[0,170,170,170]Smith and Wesson Model 500 is a five-shot, double/single action large-bore revolver firing the .500SW Magnum cartridge - the most powerful handgun cartridge in existence. Mechanically it is a standard revolver - a repeating handgun that is fed from a revolving cylinder containing multiple chambers. Since the cylinder doesn't rely on gas or blowback for the cycling, it will cycle with each trigger pull, even if misfire occured - because of this, revolvers are usually considered much more reliable than semi-automatic pistols. Model 500 was built on the entirely new X-Frame, which was developed exclusively to handle the immense muzzle velocity and pressures generated by the .500 Magnum cartridge. Instead of a traditional barrel, the SW500 uses a rifled tube inside a barrel shroud that is secured by tension from the front. This tensioning leads to stability, making barrels cheaper to produce and resulting in a more accurate revolver. The advanced design of the firearm helps in counteracting the recoil felt by the shooter. This includes the sheer weight of the firearm, use of rubber grips, the forward balance, and the use of a compensator. Nonetheless, the .500SW cartridge produces immense recoil, there were cases when the Model 500 simply flew off hands of untrained shooters. It is used only as a recreational or big-game hunting weapon, because of high recoil follow-up shots are almost impossible to take unless the shooter is strong and has excellent training, and it is advised against using it as a defensive weapon against human attackers, muggers or intruders. These guns gained unexpected rise in popularity in Eastern Europe after Exclusion Zone emerged in Ukraine. Since this place has high activity of wild animals and mutants and it is more probable that inhabitants and stalkers will be attacked by them rather than human attackers, high caliber Magnum revolvers, including the SW500, became an obvious choice as a defensive carry weapon. While less powerful cartridges such as .44Mag and .50AE are enough in most cases, the .500SW weapons also became used by mutant hunters and stalkers exploring The Zone for their sheer power and ability to kill even most fierce mutants in few hits.\n \n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Reliability: %c[0,170,170,170]high\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Durability: %c[0,170,170,170]high\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Ergonomics: %c[0,170,170,170]below average</text>

Revolver is a repeating handgun that is fed from a revolving cylinder containing multiple chambers. Since the cylinder doesn't rely on gas or blowback for the cycling, it will cycle with each trigger pull, even if misfire occured - because of this, revolvers are usually considered much more reliable than semi-automatic pistols. They however have very complicated internals and are expensive to manufacture. Taurus revolvers are based on Smith and Wesson designs, they are less finely-finished but are also much cheaper. Raging Bull Model 444 is chambered in powerful .44 Magnum cartridge. The Raging Bull's distinguishing feature is a ported barrel and a red rubber strip along the back of its cushion grip. Those features improve the handling and reduce the recoil compared to other .44 Magnum revolvers. The Bull has opinion of a reliable and relatively well made revolver, but it's durability and barrel life is still lower than that of high-end guns. It is nonetheless good enough for typical gun owner who need a weapon for personal defense or hunting. .44 Magnum loads have way higher recoil than standard handgun rounds or even .357 Magnum, which makes pulling off follow up shots harder, so they're not advised as a weapon against human attackers for those who haven't mastered this caliber. However, due to it's high power it is very effective at defeating wild animals, which makes it fit for both defensive use and hunting. .44 Magnum revolvers, together with Taurus M44, are a popular sidearm in areas with high activity of wild animals, such as Alaska or Ukrainian Exclusion Zone. In the latter case, the .44 Mag revolvers are often used as sidearms by mutant hunters, who need weapons using powerful ammunition that will provide highest possible ballistic performance.\n \n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Reliability: %c[0,170,170,170]very high\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Durability: %c[0,170,170,170]high\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Ergonomics: %c[0,170,170,170]above average</text>

The frame, cylinder, and barrel of the MR73 are made from ordnance-certified, alloyed steel. Barrels are manufactured by cold-hammering. The rifling is formed during the forging process, eliminating the need to cut the rifling as a separate manufacturing step. This creates an extremely hard and microscopically smooth internal barrel surface. MR-73 and MR-96 are used by multiple police forces, including GIGN. MR-96 are very rare on market and they reach relatively high prices. .357 Magnum loads have higher recoil than standard handgun rounds, but are nonetheless still controllable. Due to it's high power it is effective at defeating both human attackers and wild animals. Because of this, .357 Magnum revolvers, together with Model 19, are still a popular sidearm for personal defense against robberies and in areas with high activity of wild animals, such as Alaska or Ukrainian Exclusion Zone.\n \n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Reliability: %c[0,170,170,170]very high\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Durability: %c[0,170,170,170]very high\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Ergonomics: %c[0,170,170,170]average</text>

These modifications are done at home or in amateur workshops. This one is based on Ruger Redhawk. The Ruger Redhawk is a DA/SA, large-frame revolver that was first introduced in 1979 by Sturm Ruger and Company. Made from high-grade steel, it is available in a stainless steel finish. Revolver is a repeating handgun that is fed from a revolving cylinder containing multiple chambers. Since the cylinder doesn't rely on gas or blowback for the cycling, it will cycle with each trigger pull, even if misfire occured - because of this, revolvers are usually considered much more reliable than semi-automatic pistols. They however have very complicated internals and are expensive to manufacture. The Redhawk is reinforced to handle extra stress of high-pressure loads, making it very popular for use by handloaders as it is able to handle the most powerful .45 Colt and .44 Magnum loads easily. In addition, the cylinder itself is longer than most competitors', allowing ammunition to be loaded to a longer overall length. This allows for either increased powder capacity, heavier (and therefore longer) bullets without compromising the powder load, or a combination of both. Custom ammunition manufacturers even have loads made specifically for Ruger revolvers that cannot fit in shorter chambers or revolvers of weaker construction (such as the Smith and Wesson Model 29). This makes the Redhawk a good choice as a bear defense gun among hunters and trappers. .44 Magnum revolvers, together with Redhawk, are a popular sidearm in areas with high activity of wild animals, such as Alaska or Ukrainian Exclusion Zone.\n \n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Reliability: %c[0,170,170,170]very high\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Durability: %c[0,170,170,170]very high\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Ergonomics: %c[0,170,170,170]above average</text>

The AR-15 is an American 5.56x45mm assault rifle developed by Eugene Stoner in 1960s. It was designed as a lightweight automatic rifle using a modern, light, small-bore ammunition which allowed the soldier to carry more ammunition. In 1960 first AR-15 rifles were ordered for USAF, and in 1963 the rifle was officially adopted as the M16. It serves up to this day in multiple variants and is still considered to be one of the most universal and modular weapons in the world. AR-15s are also well-liked by civilian gun owners, hunters and sportsmen for their accuracy, effectiveness and simplicity. Mechanically, AR-15 is a gas operated firearm that uses direct gas impingement system with a rotating bolt. The rifle has a straight-line recoil design, which reduces the muzzle rise to minimum. It is less reliable than comparable designs when dirty, but the closed system very effectively seals it from the outside, which prevents any dirt and mud from preventing the internals - this means that the AR-15s are less prone to external elements than eg. AKM. In the 2002 the 6.8 SPC cartridge was developed, and first AR-15s chambered in this cartridge appeared. It provides good terminal ballistics even when fired from short barrels (5.56 fragments only when muzzle velocity is high enough) and is only slightly heavier; the only disadvantage is it's high price. For those who don't mind higher price, for example shooting using optics, the AR-15 chambered in 6.8 SPC might be a good idea. In The Zone some of these rifles were brought in by stalkers and mercenaries who want to bring in more power to the field, especially vs mutants. \n \n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Reliability: %c[0,170,170,170]average\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Durability: %c[0,170,170,170]average\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Ergonomics: %c[0,170,170,170]high %c[0,140,140,140] \n \n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] ATTACHMENTS: 762x51 caliber compatible suppressor</text>

Mechanically, it's a select-fire, straight blowback-operated weapon that fires from the closed bolt. The cartridge used produces a very low recoil impulse and this enables simple unlocked blowback operation to be employed.

It is a simple blowback operated, selective fired weapon that fires from closed bolt. It has a separate hammer unit, with ambidextrous safety / fire mode selector, that offers single shots, 3-round bursts and full automatic fire modes. The receiver, pistol grip / trigger unit and the forend all are made from polymer. The side-folding shoulder stock is also made from polymer, and can be adjusted for length of pull due to telescopic design. The receiver has universal rails added by default, which allows for optical sights and additional attachments being mounted, depending on operator's needs. Scorpion EVO is considered to be one of the best modern submachine guns. It's produced with very high quality materials, it is very light, compact and comfortable to shoot, allowing to shoot even long bursts with minimal recoil. Multiple countries adopted EVO to their police, counter-terrorist and special forces units, including Czech Republic, Finland, Poland, Serbia and Argentina. In The Zone, EVO is used mostly by mercenaries and those who need a light and compact weapon when they need to carry heavy weight and loot, or those who carry an unwieldy primary weapon such as heavy sniper rifles, and need something for protection in close range. \n \n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Reliability: %c[0,170,170,170]high\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Durability: %c[0,170,170,170]above average\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Ergonomics: %c[0,170,170,170]very high %c[0,140,140,140] \n \n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] ATTACHMENTS: 9mm-caliber compatible suppressor</text>

Shpagin. It saw extensive use in the Red Army during World War II and became one of the most famed and widely known weapons ever - it's distinct shape is instantly recognized by anyone who is interested in World War II. PPSh was developed by Georgy Shpagin in 1941 to replace expensive and less-reliable PPD-40 submachine gun. Shpagin's idea was to produce a submachine of very simple design and with parts made from metal stamping - production process that was revolutionary back then. The PPSh-41 was a great success - by the spring of 1942, the Soviet factories produced 3000 "papashas" every day, and until end of production in 1947 more than six millions of these weapons were made. Mechanically, it is a blowback operated submachine gun firing from an open bolt. To decrease the recoil stress, gun was fitted with bolt buffer at the rear of receiver. It is very simple to maintain, upon field strip only three parts come out that need to be cleaned. Most parts are made from metal stampings, stock is made of wood. It's only flaw was rushed quality control - some specimens have badly fitted parts and some can't even use magazines from other units, because they simply won't fit. Later on, only stick magazines were produced as drums were heavy, awkward to handle and increased chances of jamming. The PPSh was very efficient and reliable and was well respected even by it's opponents - Germans actually officially adopted captured PPSh-41s into service and Americans used some of them in Korean war.

Shpagin. It saw extensive use in the Red Army during World War II and became one of the most famed and widely known weapons ever - it's distinct shape is instantly recognized by anyone who is interested in World War II. PPSh was developed by Georgy Shpagin in 1941 to replace expensive and less-reliable PPD-40 submachine gun. Shpagin's idea was to produce a submachine of very simple design and with parts made from metal stamping - production process that was revolutionary back then. The PPSh-41 was a great success - by the spring of 1942, the Soviet factories produced 3000 "papashas" every day, and until end of production in 1947 more than six millions of these weapons were made. Mechanically, it is a blowback operated submachine gun firing from an open bolt. To decrease the recoil stress, gun was fitted with bolt buffer at the rear of receiver. It is very simple to maintain, upon field strip only three parts come out that need to be cleaned. Most parts are made from metal stampings, stock is made of wood. It's only flaw was rushed quality control - some specimens have badly fitted parts and some can't even use magazines from other units, because they simply won't fit. Later on, only stick magazines were produced as drums were heavy, awkward to handle and increased chances of jamming. The PPSh was very efficient and reliable and was well respected even by it's opponents - Germans actually officially adopted captured PPSh-41s into service and Americans used some of them in Korean war. High amounts of these submachine guns were sent to countries like China, Vietnam, Laos, Iraq and many others, in the end about 30 countries all around the world. Today it is still used and can be seen in the Middle East, North Africa and Ukraine.

Best used in close range. %c[0,140,140,140]  \n \n%c[0,170,170,170]APS is a Soviet machine pistol chambered in 9x18mm. It was developed as a personal defense weapon for soldiers who need more firepower than pistol can provide, but also deem an assault rifle an overkill, like artillerymen, vehicle crews and pilots, among others. Igor Stechkin made his first machine pistol as early as in 1948, and after some upgrades, in the 1951 the APS as we know it entered the service. Mechanically, it is a simple blowback pistol of steel construction, with external hammer and a double action trigger. It has a fire rate reducer installed, which lowers it's cyclic rate to 650-750 RPM - significantly lower than other typical machine pistols (like M93R or G18) that often have rates of 1000-1300RPM because of the blowback system; so the difference is very high and Stechkin is easier to control because of that. Users praised it's firepower improvement over typical pistol and compact size when compared to typical submachine gun. However, the APS was declared too heavy, uneffective on longer ranges, and also it's reliability was too low - it was jamming too often for a military weapon. The AKS-74u replaced Stechkin in rear echelon units and vehicle and team weapon crews and the new Russian SMGs replaced it in law enforcement agencies. The special operators and some soldiers however kept using it as a sidearm providing high firepower. In this role it is however also being replaced by OTs-33 Pernach. \n \n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Reliability: %c[0,170,170,170]below average\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Durability: %c[0,170,170,170]average\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Ergonomics: %c[0,170,170,170]average %c[0,140,140,140] \n \n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] ATTACHMENTS: 9mm-caliber compatible suppressor</text>

Striker-fired trigger limits practical accuracy. %c[0,140,140,140]  \n \n%c[0,170,170,170]GSh-18 is a Russian semi-automatic pistol chambered in 9x19mm Parabellum cartridge. It was developed specially for use with improved armor-piercing ammunition which produces very high chamber pressure. GSh-18 stands for names of designers, Grazev and Shipunov (famous for their aircraft autocannons, like GSh-23), 18 stands for ammo capacity. Mechanically, GSh-18 is a rotating-barrel, short recoil, locked-breech pistol with 10 locking lugs spaced equally around the barrel, the large locking surface area resulting in a strong lockup, making it suitable for high-velocity ammunition loads. The frame is made of polymer, which reduces weight greatly - GSh-18 is one of the lightest military pistols. The trigger is striker fired, like in Glock pistols, which allows for safe carrying with round in the chamber, but is relatively stiff, which limits practical accuracy. Pistol featured low bore axis, similar to sport pistols, which reduces recoil and improves accuracy. Whole GSh-18 design was made to withstand high pressure of 9x19mm armor-piercing loads, which makes the pistol more resistant to wear from shooting, however, users reported inadequate quality of slide and various parts, which makes the pistol more prone to breakages from different mechanical damage. Another disadvantage is trouble with magazines, which require special tools for loading - if the tool is lost, the magazines can't be loaded past 10 rounds. The pistol also has high recoil despite low bore axis construction. Overally it is rather a niche weapon and is definitely not an universal pistol, but it's barrel life and high capacity might make it a good tool for those who can make use of AP ammunition. GSh-18 are used only by Russian army and special forces. Small batch of these pistols came with some Mercenaries groups, who are rumored to receive funding from Russia.

Mechanically, it's a gas operated, selective fire assault rifle. The gas operated action has a massive bolt carrier with a permanently attached long stroke gas piston. The bolt carrier moves on the two rails with visible clearances between the parts, which allows the gun to operate even when it's interior is severely fouled with sand or mud. Overengineered receiver and chrome lined barrel provide exceptional durability, and the well-designed cartridge dimensions and strong action allow for reliable feeding in almost all conditions, even when the weapon is very dirty and/or corroded. Due to it's great balance of firepower, accuracy, reliability and low price, the AK is often considered the "gold standard" and a point of reference among assault rifles. AKM has many improvements over first AK-47s, biggest ones being stamped receiver, which reduced weight by nearly 1 kilogram compared to milled receiver AK, new barrel mount type that improves accuracy and straight buttstock made of plywood, which reduces felt recoil and is more resistant than old-type stock made from one part of wood. All these changes make AKM even more effective weapon than original AK-47.

Relatively low weight for a steel pistol. %c[0,140,140,140]  \n \n%c[0,170,170,170]TT-33 is a Soviet semi-automatic pistol chambered in 7.62x25mm TT round. It was developed in the early 1930s by F. Tokarev as a service pistol for the Soviet military to replace the already obsolete Nagant M1895 revolver. It served in Soviet military until 1952 when it started being replaced by Makarov's PM pistol. Almost 2 millions of these pistols were produced and after the war were used multiple countries that used USSR's military aid. Externally, the TT-33 is very similar to John Browning's blowback operated FN Model 1903 semiautomatic pistol, and internally it uses Browning's short recoil tilting-barrel system from the M1911 pistol. The Tokarev TT is a short recoil operated, locked breech pistol of all-steel construction. It wasn't the best design and often failed. The single action trigger has no safeties. The only safe way to carry TT is to always have an empty chamber. The production quality was rather low, and unlike other Soviet designs, in TT-33 it is actually a big problem. The pistols' durability is sub-par and it rusts quickly, so it requires a lot of maintenance. Nonetheless, the TT-33 is in no way an ineffective weapon and if kept clean it will serve it's owner well. It's biggest advantage in modern times is it's chambering - 7.62x25mm round is very powerful and can penetrate soft body armor. This ability, together with it's low price which made it basically a throw-away weapon made it a perfect choice of assassination weapon for mafia members in 1990s Russia. TT pistols are plentiful on black market and are very common in The Zone. Very low price make them a good choice for rookie stalkers who don't have much money to spend on more modern handgun. \n \n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Reliability: %c[0,170,170,170]average\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Durability: %c[0,170,170,170]average\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Ergonomics: %c[0,170,170,170]below average %c[0,140,140,140] \n \n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] ATTACHMENTS: 9mm or lower caliber compatible suppressor</text>

The designers were tasked with resolving the difficulty of controlling recoil in full-auto mode present in the Stechkin APS pistol and simplifying it for combat deployment. The new pistol has a "square" shape, which is simpler (and less expensive) to manufacture and has a novel operating principle that increases controllability and reduces recoil. OTs-33 is a hammer fired, blowback operated handgun with double action trigger. The construction is all steel. Fire selector and manual safety are present. To reduce recoil and muzzle rise, some propellant gases are diverted into a ported slide cavity that acts as a muzzle brake and compensator, deflecting the gases upward to stabilize the barrel. Thanks to it, Pernach is easier to control than APS. It however still has some drawbacks, most notably it's weight, dimensions and awkward double action trigger. OTs-33 was adopted into MVD and law enforcement agencies, but it didn't replace APS completely. Some of these handguns reached the black market in the exlusion zone, where they are well liked and used as a sidearm for extra firepower, just like all other machine pistols. \n \n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Reliability: %c[0,170,170,170]above average\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Durability: %c[0,170,170,170]average\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Ergonomics: %c[0,170,170,170]average %c[0,140,140,140] \n \n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] ATTACHMENTS: 9mm-caliber compatible suppressor</text>

Kar98k is in essence a shortened version of Gewehr 98 rifle which was the service rifle of German army from 1898 and became the most successful bolt-action rifle of it's time. German army found that shortening the barrel greatly improved handling and made maneuvering the rifle much easier, while the loss of accuracy and range was almost non-existant. That way the Kar98k became the service rifle of German army and completely replaced the long and unwieldy Gew98. Mechanically, the Mauser Kar98k is a manually operated, bolt-action rifle fed from internal, non-removable magazine holding 5 rounds. It uses bolt of Mauser M98 system, which is extremely reliable and works very smoothly. Kar98k bolt handle is bend downwards, which makes it easier to store and carry and also allows for more comfortable bolt operation over straight bolt, like in Gew98 or Mosin rifle. Mauser action became the most successful bolt-action design in the world and almost every modern bolt action rifle, including high-end sniper rifles, use Mauser type action. The magazine is loaded from top via clips or single rounds. Sights consist of simple notch front sight and leaf type rear sight, which allow for relatively good practical accuracy. Overally, Kar98k is an extremely successful design, by many considered to be the best bolt-action rifle of WWII. It provides extremely high reliability, easiness of use, simple construction and high accuracy. It was however criticized for it's sights, which are rather obsolete compared to peep sights of M1903A3 or Lee-Enfield sights that provide longer sight line, allowing for more precise aiming. 15 millions of Kar98k rifles were produced to 1945.

Whole external housing, carrying handle and folding stock is made of carbon fiber-reinforced polymer which is very durable and immune to corrosion. MG36 has a slightly heavier barrel which can fire higher amount of rounds without overheating.

It also has a bipod mounted by default. The weapon feeds from 100-rounds Beta C-Mag, which however sometimes jams easily; standard G36 magazines can be used when needed. MG36 comes with 3x telescopic sight and reflex sight combo just like standard G36, some were modified to use RIS rail handles instead, on which other optical sights can be mounted. Overally, the MG36 wasn't a very successful weapon and is no longer offered by HK.

The weapon works on Gauss rifle (also known as coil gun) principle. It is a type of projectile accelerator consisting of one or more coils used as electromagnets in the configuration of a linear motor that accelerate a ferromagnetic or conducting projectile to high velocity. Since the electromagnets require very high energy to reliably accelerate projectiles, it was first developed as a mounted anti-tank gun, but after Soviet Union collapsed, the works on the Gauss gun stopped. It is unknown what happened with the project after the Second Disaster, but small arms similar to resized Soviet Gauss anti-tank guns started being found in hands of Monolith fighters. Scientific analysis found that the weapon uses the power of Flash artifact to supply the coils with energy and sends 9mm projectiles down range with ultra high velocity. The rifle is incredibly accurate and has very flat trajectory. The projectile's velocity provides very high penetration, exceeding that of high-velocity bullets with tungsten-core fired from classic firearms that use combustion gases as means of shooting bullets. Since the velocity is very high, the projectile ice-picks through tissue and does relatively low damage compared to it's huge energy, but it's still roughly equivalent of .338 Lapua Magnum bullet. Contrary to popular belief, the Gauss rifle has high recoil due to very high energy, but as the energy is dispersed over time it is greatly reduced compared to sheer power. The Object 62 rifles are very powerful sniper and anti-materiel rifles and are extremely expensive. All Object 62 rifles are an object of interest to military and should be brought back for military evaluation.  \n \n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Reliability: %c[0,170,170,170]high\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Durability: %c[0,170,170,170]below average\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Ergonomics: %c[0,170,170,170]low %c[0,140,140,140] \n \n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] ATTACHMENTS: 3-9x Leupold sniper scope (permanent)</text>

In the grenade-launching configuration, a single trigger controls both the 40mm launcher and the rifle itself, with a separate barrel selector. Today, some of these rifles are used by Ukrainian special forces sent to The Zone, as their compact size makes them fit for airborne troops, and good terminal performance makes them effective in close combat. Just like AKS-74u, this weapon is prone to overheating and it's specific gas system means it is quickly getting dirty, requiring care and constant cleaning. It's finish quality leaves much to desire, which can possibly mean it's durability is not on par with other AK types. It's handling is very good and it's very effective in close quarters, but it's short line of sight and awkward, heavy trigger makes it very poor weapon for longer ranges.

OTs-14 Groza (Russian: "Thunderstorm") is based on the standard AKS-74u receiver and action, modified for the larger 9x39 subsonic ammunition favored by various Spetsnaz troops for it's very good penetration factor and terminal ballistics. In the grenade-launching configuration, a single trigger controls both the 40mm launcher and the rifle itself, with a separate barrel selector. Today, some of these rifles are used by Ukrainian special forces sent to The Zone, as their compact size makes them fit for airborne troops, and good terminal performance makes them effective in close combat. Just like AKS-74u, this weapon is prone to overheating and it's specific gas system means it is quickly getting dirty, requiring care and constant cleaning. It's finish quality leaves much to desire, which can possibly mean it's durability is not on par with other AK types. It's handling is very good and it's very effective in close quarters, but it's short line of sight and awkward, heavy trigger makes it very poor weapon for longer ranges. They can also be found on black market and in hands of Mercenary groups. A number of these rifles were also seen in hands of Duty force recon groups, which started suspicions that Duty is being secretly supported by Military or Mercenaries, who supply them with weapons and ammunition.\n \n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Reliability: %c[0,170,170,170]above average\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Durability: %c[0,170,170,170]average\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Ergonomics: %c[0,170,170,170]above average %c[0,140,140,140] \n \n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] ATTACHMENTS: PO 4x34 scope, dedicated suppressor (integral) </text>

It was one of the most successful semi-automatic pistols of it's times and was the first of "wonder nine" pistols, starting a new era in world handgun development. Hi-Power was designed by famous genius firearms inventor John Browning (also creator of M1911 pistol). It was a recoil operated, locked breech pistol using linkless cam locking system (a change from M1911 system). The construction is all steel with wooden or polymer grips; the trigger is single action only. The most important feature of HP is it's high capacity, which was achieved by use of a staggered column magazine for 13 rounds - typical pistols of 1920s held no more than 8 rounds, often even less. Browning HP had a huge advantage over these pistols, especially since it's not any bigger than typical pistol of that time. For a very long time the Browning HP was considered one of the best pistols in the world, outclassing the competition with it's reliability and firepower. It was adopted by more than 50 countries, among them UK, Canada, Australia, Germany, France, Argentina and many more. After 82 years of continuous production, the Hi-Power was finally discontinued in 2017, but these pistols still remain in use by many armies. Overally, the Browning HP is a reliable and durable pistol with high capacity magazine. It was definitely the best pistol of it's time and still remains a viable weapon. It's disadvantages however are relatively heavy weight with big dimensions (like all steel pistols of these times) and a heavy trigger, especially for a single action pistol. A lot of these pistols reached the black market after being withdrawn and are one of the most common handguns in the Europe. They are very popular in The Zone as they are available for cheaper than modern 9x19mm handguns.

FN FAL was a very good weapon, but it was heavy and used full-power rifle cartridge (7.62x51mm) which produced high recoil and made follow-up shots harder; apart from that, soldiers could carry much more 5.56x45mm ammunition.

In Gulf War the weapon jammed so notoriously that it was deemed one of the worst assault rifles in the entire world.

It is based on AR-15 rifle and was designed as upgrade for it. The AR-15 is an American 5.56x45mm assault rifle developed by Eugene Stoner in 1960s. It was designed as a lightweight automatic rifle using a modern, light, small-bore ammunition which allowed the soldier to carry more ammunition. AR-15 is a gas operated firearm that uses direct gas impingement system with a rotating bolt. The rifle has a straight-line recoil design, which reduces the muzzle rise to minimum. It is however less reliable than comparable designs when dirty, and the receiver extension, which is a long buffer tube, an integral part of the cycling system, doesn't allow the folding stock to be mounted (the AR-15 stock is actually mounted "around" this tube). LR-300 design changes it by using an adapted version of the standard direct impingement gas system which removes the need for a receiver extension. The gas key, which contains the return spring, is extended beyond its normal length to form an operation rod, like in M14 or AKM, extending into the top of the forward handguard, the bolt carrier is also only half as long; in result, there's no need for the recoil buffer tube, which is normally protruding backwards into the stock. In the end the LR-300 is more compact while being even slightly more reliable than the typical AR-15 type rifle like M4 or M16. Apart from that, LR-300 is basically the same as every other AR-15. It has same lower receiver, trigger and barrel. On top of the receiver there is RIS rail that allows for mounting optics and other attachments. LR-300 was only bought in limited numbers for few police departments in the USA and some were bought by PMC groups. These rifles received media attention when they were spotted in The Zone, where one of the mercenary teams (probably part of one of PMC companies mentioned before) fielded these weapons. Some were also sold on black market and, just like other AR-15s, received relatively high popularity among stalkers, who praise it for it's light weight and exceptional ergonomics, especially when compared to heavier and less comfortable AK rifles. \n \n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Reliability: %c[0,170,170,170]average\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Durability: %c[0,170,170,170]average\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Ergonomics: %c[0,170,170,170]very high %c[0,140,140,140] \n \n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] ATTACHMENTS: SUSAT scope, 5.56 caliber compatible suppressor</text>

It is one of the most widely known weapons in the world and became somewhat of a symbol of special forces and counter-terrorist groups. To this day the MP5 is considered a gold standard of the submachine guns. More than 100 variants of MP5 were made, all to perfectly fit needs of their operators. Most important are A2 (fixed stock), A3 (telescopic stock), SD (integrated suppressor) and MP5K (shortened PDW). A2 and A3 with burst mode are called A4 and A5. Mechanically, MP5 is a submachine gun of all-steel construction using a roller-delayed blowback action, firing from closed bolt. Whole receiver is made of stamped sheet metal, which makes MP5 easy and cheap to manufacture. The furniture is made of strong synthetic polymer. Iron sights are the same diopter sights like on G3, but adjusted to 9x19mm round. The hammer-forged barrel is free floating, which gives MP5 unmatched accuracy, limited only by 9x19mm rounds' ballistics. One of the biggest advantages of MP5 is extremely low recoil which is very easy to control, even when shooting long bursts. The MP5 is a reliable and durable weapon, however, there were reports of it jamming when not maintained properly, so it should be cleaned often. MP5 was adopted by more than 40 countries, mostly by special forces, law enforcement and counter-terrorist groups. Multiple mercenary groups also use MP5s with great success. A number of MP5 submachine guns reached the black market and are available in The Zone, where they are well liked for their great handling, low weight and compact size, making it very good weapon for scavengers and artifact hunters who don't need a fighting weapon and just want something light to carry on them for personal defense from mutants and bandits at close range.

One of the biggest advantages of MP5 is extremely low recoil which is very easy to control, even when shooting long bursts. The MP5 is a reliable and durable weapon, however, there were reports of it jamming when not maintained properly, so it should be cleaned often. MP5SD was adopted by many countries' special forces for use in stealth missions.

Reliable, but requires good maintenance. %c[0,140,140,140]  \n \n%c[0,170,170,170]MP40 is a German WWII 9x19mm submachine gun developed in 1938 by Erma Werke in Third Reich. It was often nicknamed Schmeisser, as allies believed Hugo Schmeisser to be designer of this weapon (he was designer of MP18 and MP28), but it's not true - MP40's designer was Heinrich Vollmer. The MP40 is considered to be one of the best submachine guns of the World War II and long after. Mechanically, the MP40 is a blowback operated weapon that fires from an open bolt. It was fully-automatic only, but a relatively slow rate of fire permitted single shots with short trigger pulls. The proprietary bolt system with telescoped return spring guide served as a pneumatic recoil buffer, helping to decrease the rate of fire to a very manageable level. The folding shoulder stock made the MP40 very compact when folded. MP40 was made entirely out of stamped steel, which made it cheap and quick to manufacture. It was accurate, had extremely low recoil (thanks to it's low rate of fire and specific construction) and was made with very high quality. It's reliability was above average, lower than Soviet weapons like PPSh but better than other SMGs of that time. The MP40 was the standard SMG of German military. After WWII MP40s were sent to other countries as military aid, most notably Israel, Syria, Libya, China, Vietnam and Korea. In Vietnam, US special forces used MP40s instead of American weapons. A lot of MP40s reached the black market and resurfaced in various places in the world, including The Zone, where, just like all other old submachine guns, are used as weapons for personal defense by those who don't need heavy and long rifles. Such SMGs, with their compact size, are well liked by scavengers and artifact hunters who need as much mobility as possible. They are used as cheap alternative to more modern submachine guns, but due to excessive weight they usually aren't very well liked and are used only by those who can't afford more modern weapons. \n \n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Reliability: %c[0,170,170,170]average\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Durability: %c[0,170,170,170]average\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Ergonomics: %c[0,170,170,170]above average %c[0,140,140,140] \n \n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] ATTACHMENTS: none</text>

Since its introduction it's considered a serious competitor to MP5 and UMP. Its operating system is pretty unique for a submachine gun, as it's a gas-operated firearm, featuring a closed, rotating bolt. The construction is based on AR-15 layout, and the MPX keeps its ergonomics and controls style. It has an aluminium alloy receiver, which reduces weight. Receiver has accessory rails which allow user to add necessary accessories and optical sights. Unlike most other submachine guns, the SIG MPX is a gas operated weapon, utilizing short-stroke gas piston and rotary bolt locking. MPX shoots from closed bolt for increased accuracy and safety. It is a completely modular weapon, user can configure it to use different calibers - so far in offer are 9x19mm, .40SW and .357 SIG. Barrels can be quickly replaced without need for any tools. Overally, SIG MPX is a true modern submachine gun, light, compact, modular and reliable. In The Zone, MPX submachine guns are rarely available on black market and are well liked for their great handling, low weight and compact size, making it very good weapon for scavengers and artifact hunters who don't need a heavy fighting weapon and just want something light to carry on them for personal defense from mutants and bandits at close range.

Spectre is a striker-fired, recoil-operated submachine gun firing from a closed bolt. The receiver of the Spectre is made from thin stamped steel. The bolt is so designed that it acts as an air pump to push air through barrel shroud and provide additional cooling for the barrel and action, which is very useful when firing long bursts. A simplistic stock is available, but sometimes this weapon was also used without any stock. High-capacity magazines hold 50 rounds of 9x19mm rounds, which allows for prolonged shooting, even though the weapon shoots very rapidly at 850 rounds per minute. Overally, the Spectre is a very compact submachine gun/machine pistol hybrid, but it's capacity and firepower is pretty high.

The PK is a gas operated, belt fed, air cooled machine gun firing from open bolt. The gas system consists of a gas chamber with a manual gas regulator and a long stroke gas piston located below the barrel. Unlike the AK and RPK, the PK machine gun is an open bolt design, which reduces overheating during automatic fire due to the airflow allowed into the chamber and the barrel. The belt is mounted from the right side. PK utilizes a two-stage belt feed from steel non-disintegrating belts. Receiver is made from 1.5mm thick stamped sheet steel. For additional rigidity and strength the PK receiver features double walls made from 1.5 mm steel plates. The heavy barrel is quick-changeable and is chromed for rust protection. Muzzle threading allows for mounting various muzzle devices. Skeletonized stock is made from birch plywood laminates. PKM is slightly lighter than PK, weighting 7.5kg, which makes it lightest GPMG in service. It's light weight, very high reliability and durability coupled with high firepower gave the PKM legendary fame, it is considered by many to be the best GPMGs in the world. It is used by more than 80 countries, among them Russia, Ukraine, West Germany, Yugoslavia, China, Finland and Poland. Poland and Yugoslavia made their own versions in 7.62x51mm NATO, which have even higher reliability due to use of non-rimmed cartridge. In The Zone, the PKM is commonly used by Ukrainian military as service weapon, and by stalkers as a weapon for support, defense or mutant hunting. Loners usually don't like LMGs for their excessive weight and they are usually only used as defensive weapons at camps, however, mutant hunters (especially from Duty) often employ at least one light machine gun in squad to increase their firepower to maximum when hunting dangerous mutants. \n \n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Reliability: %c[0,170,170,170]very high\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Durability: %c[0,170,170,170]very high\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Ergonomics: %c[0,170,170,170]low </text>

Just like PM, it is a semi-automatic pistol chambered in 9x18mm round. Straight blowback pistols, like Walther PP or Makarov PM, do not suppress well since the increased rearward pressure speeds up the slide and dumps a bunch of gas out the chamber end of the barrel, so a specially modified PB pistol was made for quiet shooting. PM is a compact, straight-blowback-action, all-steel construction, frame-fixed barrel handgun. It uses 9x18mm round which is at the limit of what a blowback design can withstand. The PB's firing mechanism and design is based on that of the Makarov pistol. Because the front part of the barrel is covered by the suppressor, the slide is very short, such that it does not allow placing a return spring into it. For that reason, the spring is in the grip, and acts on the slide by means of a long lever. Just like PM, the PB is very reliable, durable, relatively easy to use and maintain and works flawlessly. It is small and easy to conceal. SA/DA trigger allows for safe carrying with a round in the chamber. In The Zone, PB pistols are sometimes employed by military, special forces and mercenaries for stealth action. Stalkers sometimes use these pistols to kill stray dogs without making much noise. \n \n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Reliability: %c[0,170,170,170]high\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Durability: %c[0,170,170,170]high\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Ergonomics: %c[0,170,170,170]above average %c[0,140,140,140] \n \n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] ATTACHMENTS: Dedicated PB silencer (permanent)</text>

Antiquated now by the Russian Saiga-12 and the American AA-12, the Protecta was a revolutionary weapon created by the Apartheid government in the 1980s. This smoothbore combat revolver-type shotgun was intended to provide extreme firepower for militarized units. The weapon benefits from a large magazine and a high effective rate of fire, but its bulkiness and considerable weight, combined with a long reload time, are the price to be paid for these advantages. Rare in the Zone and used primarily to clear confined spaces of mutants. This particular model of the Armsel Protecta is using the common m81 woodland camouflage.

The PK is a gas operated, belt fed, air cooled machine gun firing from open bolt. The gas system consists of a gas chamber with a manual gas regulator and a long stroke gas piston located below the barrel. Unlike the AK and RPK, the PK machine gun is an open bolt design, which reduces overheating during automatic fire due to the airflow allowed into the chamber and the barrel. The belt is mounted from the right side. PK utilizes a two-stage belt feed from steel non-disintegrating belts. Receiver is made from 1.5mm thick stamped sheet steel. For additional rigidity and strength the PK receiver features double walls made from 1.5 mm steel plates. The heavy barrel is quick-changeable and is chromed for rust protection. Muzzle threading allows for mounting various muzzle devices. Skeletonized stock is made from birch plywood laminates. PKM is slightly lighter than PK, weighting 7.5kg, which makes it lightest GPMG in service. It's light weight, very high reliability and durability coupled with high firepower gave the PKM legendary fame, it is considered by many to be the best GPMGs in the world. It is used by more than 80 countries, among them Russia, Ukraine, West Germany, Yugoslavia, China, Finland and Poland. Poland and Yugoslavia made their own versions in 7.62x51mm NATO, which have even higher reliability due to use of non-rimmed cartridge. In The Zone, the PKM is commonly used by Ukrainian military as service weapon, and by stalkers as a weapon for support, defense or mutant hunting. Loners usually don't like LMGs for their excessive weight and they are usually only used as defensive weapons at camps, however, mutant hunters (especially from Duty) often employ at least one light machine gun in squad to increase their firepower to maximum when hunting dangerous mutants. \n \n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Reliability: %c[0,170,170,170]very high\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Durability: %c[0,170,170,170]very high\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Ergonomics: %c[0,170,170,170]low </text>

The idea for new construction came from Soviet experiences in Afghanistan and local conflicts, which shown a neccessity for a weapon better suited for prolonged firefights. It was named after the ancient nomadic, warlike tribe from Central Asia, who lived in what would later be known as steppes of Southern Russia. The PKP, just like PK, is a gas operated, belt fed, air cooled machine gun firing from open bolt. The gas system consists of a gas chamber with a manual gas regulator and a long stroke gas piston located below the barrel. The belt is mounted from the right side. PKP utilizes a two-stage belt feed from steel non-disintegrating belts. The receiver is made from thick stamped sheet steel. The main feature of PKP is the barrel, which, curiously is not meant to be changeable in the field, but is heavier than PK's, has cooling ribs and is enclosed in a steel jacket (which features a distinctive looking carrying handle), which runs up to the muzzle to provide forced air cooling, similarly to the famous vintage Lewis LMG of the first world war. Cooling air enters the jacket through oval windows at the rear of the jacket, and exits at the muzzle. Another change from the parent design is the location of the integral, non-removable folding bipod which is placed near the muzzle. This feature is said to improve stability and long-range accuracy when firing from the bipod, however it also limits the arc of fire and makes it harder to shoot from the hip. It weights 8.7kg, which is noticeably heavier than PKM (1.2kg more), but still much less than western designs like M240 (12.5kg). Overally, PKP is more durable than PKM, but also heavier and less maneuverable. It's barrel overheats slower, but also is impossible to quick-change when needed. Whether those advantages are worth those drawbacks depends on the situation.

Best used on medium and long range with sniper rounds. %c[0,140,140,140]  \n \n%c[0,170,170,170]SG 550 SR is a sniper variant of Sturmgewehr 550, a 5.56x45mm assault rifle developed by Swiss Arms AG in Switzerland in the late 1970s. Differences from SG550 are heavy, hammer-forged, accurized barrel, refined, two-stage trigger (only 1/3 of standard pull weight), ergonomic, regulated pistol grip and special stock with cheek rest. The rifle comes with a bipod and Zeiss 10x scope by default. The rifle is extremely accurate for a semi-automatic design and is said to achieve sub-MoA accuracy with right ammunition. Rest is basically same as in SG550. It was based on AK action, but in extremely modernized package. SG550 is a gas operated, select fire rifle with gas piston and long stroke action. It has adjustable gas valve to improve it's performance in harsh environment. Furniture is from strengthened polymer, and the receiver is made from stamped steel and has two major parts, upper and lower. The heavy, cold hammer-forged barrel is screwed into the upper receiver and is equipped with a slotted "bird cage" type flash suppressor that is also used to launch rifle grenades or attach a bayonet. The gas system's components are made of stainless steel, the barrel, bolt and other parts are all made with steel that has been gas nitrided, hardened and tempered to provide highest possible protection from rust and damage - in effect the SG550 is incredibly reliable and durable rifle. SG550SR didn't gain wider popularity and is no longer produced. It is used by few counter-terrorist groups and law enforcement agencies. In The Zone some of them came in hands of mercenaries, but are very rarely seen. SG550SR is a very accurate rifle, but due to it's weaker 5.56x45mm ammunition it is considered less universal than full-size scoped rifles, nonetheless, despite it's niche usefulness, the SG550SR is one of the most refined sniper rifles available and reach very high prices on the black market. \n \n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Reliability: %c[0,170,170,170]high\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Durability: %c[0,170,170,170]high\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Ergonomics: %c[0,170,170,170]above average %c[0,140,140,140] \n \n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] ATTACHMENTS: 2.5-10x Zeiss Diavari-Z variable magnification scope (permanent)</text>

Overally, the SG550 is a very accurate, reliable and effective weapon. Despite using AK type of action, the rearrangement allowed it to be very accurate, unlike typical AK variants. Long barrel allows 5.56mm bullet to reach high velocities, which improve it's terminal performance, as it relies on velocity to yaw and fragment in the tissue. SG550 is a service rifle of Swiss Army and it's variants are adopted by Canada, Finland, France, Germany, UK, USA and many more. In The Zone, the SG550 are used by multiple mercenary groups, some of them were stolen in widely reported incident in 2011 and ended up on Ukrainian black market, where they are very sought after and highly valued by stalkers for their high accuracy, long range and high reliability, even in harsh anomalous areas.

SVD is a semi-automatic, gas-operated rifle with a short-stroke gas-piston system. The rifle's receiver is machined to provide additional accuracy and torsional strength.

Dragunov in Soviet Union in early 1960s. "Lynx" rifles were modified and assembled by Clear Sky technician known as "Grey", as his faction didn't have enough real bolt-action sniper rifles for guarding their territory in open area of Pripyat marshes. After the faction grew in strenght, these rifles were sold and now are going from hands to hands. This rifle uses modern Russian POSP scope with 3-9x variable magnification which gives it high advantage over standard SVD. Differences from standard SVD are match trigger, improved gas system and new furniture. The rear part of the barrel is enclosed into tubular steel jacket, which in turn is located within polymer handguards. This relieves the barrel from the stress imposed by handguards and bipod, making it "half-free-floating", which improves accuracy. The rest is same as in SVD rifle. SVD is a semi-automatic, gas-operated rifle with a short-stroke gas-piston system. The rifle's receiver is machined to provide additional accuracy and torsional strength. The barrel profile is relatively thin to save weight and is ended with a permanently fixed, slotted flash suppressor. The barrel’s bore is chrome-lined for increased corrosion resistance. The Dragunov's receiver bears a number of similarities to the AK action, but those are primarily cosmetic in nature. SVD's accuracy is at ~3.5 MoA, enough for typical DMR use at ranges of below 600m; features of "Lynx" improve practical accuracy to about 2 MoA, on par with more advanced western rifles. In The Zone, the SVD is very common, as it is service weapon of Ukrainian military. A lot of them were stolen from warehouses or bought from corrupt military officials. Customized SVDs with improved optics, like Lynx, are considered very effective and are highly sought after by stalkers. \n \n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Reliability: %c[0,170,170,170]high\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Durability: %c[0,170,170,170]high\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Ergonomics: %c[0,170,170,170]average %c[0,140,140,140] \n \n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] ATTACHMENTS: 9x POSP 3-9x42 variable magnification scope (permanent)</text>

The SVU was developed in early 1990s to meet the needs of the security forces of the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs, such as OMON - they needed a more compact rifle than the long Dragunov. The basic action of the SVU-AS rifle is inherited from Dragunov SVD sniper rifle - it is a semi-automatic, gas-operated rifle with a short-stroke gas-piston system. Receiver is steel and furniture is made of polymer. Because of bullpup layout, the buttplate is attached directly to the receiver, and pistol grip and scope mount are moved forward. Barrel is shortened and equipped with multi-purpose muzzle device acting as a flash hider, sound dampener and a muzzle brake. It is said to reduce sound signature by 20% and reduce recoil by 40%.

TOZ-34 is an over and under (O/U) double barrel shotgun manufactured by Tulsky Oruzheiny Zavod (Russian: Tula Arms Factory) in Soviet Union. It was designed in 1964 and it is still produced. Like all other Soviet hunting weapons, it is a simple design, without decorations or any revolutionary solutions, but is a solid piece of work and does it's job as intended, all that for unmatched price. It has a "monoblock" construction, the breech area, including the locking lugs, are machined from one piece. These shotguns were popular among hunters and civilian shooting enthusiasts and were brought to The Zone by stalkers who owned them or bought them on black market. Two barrels hold one shell each and can be fired both in the same time. One disadvantage of SxS setup is that barrels of a double-barreled shotgun are not parallel, but slightly angled, so that shots from the barrels converge, usually at about 40 meters out. For the O/U configuration with a parallel rib, both barrels' discharges will keep to the dead center, but the discharge from the "under" barrel will shoot higher than the discharge from the "over" barrel after 40 yards. Thus, double-barreled shotguns are accurate only at practical shotgun ranges, though the range of their ammunition easily exceeds four to six times that distance. Very long barrel provides tight spread and higher muzzle velocity than typical short combat shotguns and it basically guarantees a kill on up to 75m when aimed well. However, the tight spread and it's length mean it's rather unwieldy and less effective in close quarters - some users are sawing off the barrels to make it a light and compact weapon with wider spread, nonetheless the longer barrel is definitely more effective when it comes to big game hunting. \n \n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Reliability: %c[0,170,170,170]very high\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Durability: %c[0,170,170,170]above average\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Ergonomics: %c[0,170,170,170]above average </text>

The program was shut down and M9 remained in service until 2017, but nonetheless the HK45 and it's 9x19mm counterpart, the HK P30 entered civilian and law enforcement market, becoming successful successors to USP pistol. HK45 in itself is an evolution of USP. Internal operating mechanism remains the same - HK45 is short-recoil operated, locked-breech handgun with polymer frame. Slide is designed for maximum durability, it is made of metal with protective coating. Front of the barrel is fitted with rubber ring which improves barrel-to-slide fit and enhances accuracy. Recoil system features an additional polymer buffer which decreases stress on the frame and reduces felt recoil. Trigger is of modular design, available in several versions. The biggest step forward was in terms of ergonomics. The frame, made of impact-resistant polymer, is specially designed to perfectly fit shooter's hand, it also has specially textured to improve the grip when the gun is wet. HK45 and pistols which share it's design are widely considered to have ones of the most comfortable pistol grips among those currently available on market. The newer grip and interchangeable backstraps allow the pistol to sit lower into the web of the hand, contributing to better control of the weapon and recoil management. However, in order to accomodate this smaller grip, the magazine capacity was lowered from 12 to 10. Overally, the HK45 and P30 pistols are one of the most advanced combat handguns currently available. In The Zone, these pistols are sometimes used by various mercenary groups, as well as special forces operators, foreign expeditions security and various free stalkers who value it's high reliability, ergonomics and effectiveness, despite it's high price compared to other modern 9x19mm pistols.\n \n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Reliability: %c[0,170,170,170]very high\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Durability: %c[0,170,170,170]high\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Ergonomics: %c[0,170,170,170]very high %c[0,140,140,140] \n \n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] ATTACHMENTS: .45 caliber compatible suppressor</text>

Since these three chamberings didn't gain interest of Russian government, only 9x39mm project came to life. It was at first intended to be introduced to military as a personal defense weapon (PDW), but instead it became weapon for various government organizations and law enforcement agencies as a cheaper alternative to Vikhr assault rifle. 9A-91 is slightly different from AS Val and SR-3; it is made using stamped steel parts, which are less durable, but way cheaper and quicker to produce, all parts and furniture are very simplified and crudely made. It's a gas operated firearm which utilizes a long stroke gas piston and a rotating bolt, based on the AK system, just like Val. 9A-91 was a base to VSK-94 "para-sniper" rifle.\n \n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Reliability: %c[0,170,170,170]above average\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Durability: %c[0,170,170,170]average\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Ergonomics: %c[0,170,170,170]average %c[0,140,140,140] \n \n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] ATTACHMENTS: PSO-1-1 scope, 9A-91 quick-detachable suppressor</text>

Just like Val, it was also an expensive weapon and wasn't produced in big numbers. It was used mostly with government agencies, as military lost interest in this, mainly because it wasn't possible to mass produce it quickly, but also because VSS rifles fit them best.

The P99 has a glassfiber-reinforced polymer frame and steel slide assembly. It can be broken down into its main parts or field stripped with a take down catch without the help of tools. It uses an internal striker as opposed to an external hammer, with a red-painted striker tip that protrudes from rear of the slide when the gun is cocked, as well as a loaded chamber indicator on the right side of the slide. P99 comes in several variants with different triggers, mainly DA, DAO and AS. Since this pistol is produced for police and law enforcement, the trigger pull is long and heavy - it is intentional feature to reduce chances of negligent discharge. Because of this, some shooters modify the triggers of P99 to improve practical accuracy.

Pre-set trigger noticeably lowers practical accuracy. %c[0,140,140,140]  \n \n%c[0,170,170,170]Walther P99 is a modern semi-automatic pistol developed by Carl Walther GmbH in the late 1990s for law enforcement. It is one of the most successful polymer-framed, striker fired pistols chambered in 9x19mm cartridge. Walther P99 is a short recoil-operated locked breech semi-automatic pistol that uses a modified Browning cam-lock system adapted from the Hi-Power pistol. The P99 has a glassfiber-reinforced polymer frame and steel slide assembly. It can be broken down into its main parts or field stripped with a take down catch without the help of tools. It uses an internal striker as opposed to an external hammer, with a red-painted striker tip that protrudes from rear of the slide when the gun is cocked, as well as a loaded chamber indicator on the right side of the slide. P99 comes in several variants with different triggers, mainly DA, DAO and AS. Since this pistol is produced for police and law enforcement, the trigger pull is long and heavy - it is intentional feature to reduce chances of negligent discharge. Because of this, some shooters modify the triggers of P99 to improve practical accuracy. P99 is very light and has very good, ergonomic grip, widely considered to be one of the most comfortable among all modern pistols. Magazine holds 15 rounds. P99 is closest in comparison to Glock 19 pistol, with which it shares the capacity and striker-fired construction. Glock is usually considered better designed for military use, while P99 is considered to be a typical police pistol. Both of these weapons are good and the choice usually comes down to personal preference. P99 is widely used around the world and is one of the most common pistols in Europe, most notably used by police departments in Germany and Poland, and also SBU in Ukraine. In The Zone, P99 pistols are one of the most popular handguns together with Glock, PM and CZ-75 pistols. They usually come from civilian market or are smuggled in by arms dealers. Just like Glocks, they are very common and well liked by stalkers of all professions for their high reliability, high magazine capacity and 9x19mm round, which is more effective than old 9x18mm Makarov cartridge.\n \n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Reliability: %c[0,170,170,170]high\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Durability: %c[0,170,170,170]high\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Ergonomics: %c[0,170,170,170]very high %c[0,140,140,140] \n \n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] ATTACHMENTS: 9mm caliber compatible suppressor</text>

Long barrel increases muzzle velocity, which results in higher damage. Good accuracy. Rate of fire limited by manual operation. Best on close and medium range. Effective vs medium-sized mutants. %c[0,140,140,140]  \n \n%c[0,170,170,170]The Winchester Model 1894 rifle (also known as the Winchester 94 or Model 94) is a lever-action repeating rifle designed by John Browning in 1894. It was the first rifle to chamber the smokeless powder round, the .30 WCF (Winchester Center Fire, in time becoming known as the .30-30) in 1895. The Model 94's combination of potent firepower in a compact, lightweight, comfortable-to-carry, and quick-shooting package has made it an extremely popular hunting rifle, particularly for white-tailed deer in the dense forests of the Eastern United States, where most game is killed at relatively short distances. As a result, it was the first sporting rifle to sell over 7,000,000 units. The Model 1894 has been referred to as the "ultimate lever-action design" by firearms historians such as R. L. Wilson and Hal Herring. The Model 1894 is the rifle credited with the name "Winchester" being used to refer to all rifles of this type and was the first commercial sporting rifle to sell over 7,000,000 units. Overally, the M1894 is a light, accurate and effective lever-action rifle. .44 Magnum chambering has good terminal ballistics, further pushed due to longer barrel, but also has way less recoil than revolvers chambered in this round as added weight and improved ergonomics of rifle make it much easier to control. Becuase of this, it's a very good hunting and sporting weapon. Some of these rifles were used by USA, Great Britain and France during the WWI. Lever-action rifles were never very popular in Europe and it is unknown how this weapon reached The Zone. Since it's a very good hunting rifle, it might have been used by some eccentric mutant hunter who favored the .44 Magnum load. \n \n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Reliability: %c[0,170,170,170]high\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Durability: %c[0,170,170,170]high\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Ergonomics: %c[0,170,170,170]above average %c[0,140,140,140] \n \n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] ATTACHMENTS: none </text>

Slightly worse durability than standard version.

It was developed around the time of AK-74's adoption and was intended as a personal defense weapon for vehicles' crews, helicopter pilots, special forces operators and personnel that didn't need long rifles or had trouble carrying one. It is way shorter than typical infantry rifle and is even slightly shorter than comparable weapons of it's era like XM177 or HK53. Mechanically, it's a gas operated, selective fire assault rifle. The gas operated action has a massive bolt carrier with a permanently attached long stroke gas piston. It uses AK-74 gas action, but due to problems with insufficient pressure from shorter barrel, a special gas system was designed for it. Other differences from AK-74 are new, simplified rear sight, shorter handguard and side-folding stock mounted by default. In tactical sense it's something between a carbine and submachine gun - it has a 206mm (8") long barrel and a folding stock, which makes it lighter and way more maneuverable in close quarters than long AK-74 rifle.

		<text>\n \n%c[0,170,170,170]The Fairbairn–Sykes fighting knife is a double-edged fighting knife resembling a dagger or poignard with a foil grip developed by William Ewart Fairbairn and Eric Anthony Sykes in Shanghai based on concepts which the two men initiated before World War II while serving on the Shanghai Municipal Police in China. This design was made famous during World War II when issued to British Commandos, the Airborne Forces, the SAS and many other units, especially for the Normandy landings in June 1944. With its acutely tapered, sharply pointed blade, the F-S fighting knife is frequently described as a stiletto, a weapon optimised for thrusting, although the F-S knife is capable of being used to inflict slash cuts upon an opponent when its cutting edges are sharpened according to specification. The Wilkinson Sword Company made the knife with minor pommel and grip design variations. The F-S fighting knife was designed exclusively for surprise attack and fighting, with a slender blade that can easily penetrate a ribcage. The vase handle grants precise grip, and the blade's design is especially suited to its use as a fighting knife. The length of the blade was chosen to give several inches of blade to penetrate the body after passing through the 3 in (7.6 cm) of the thickest clothing that was anticipated to be worn in the war, namely that of Soviet greatcoats. Later production runs of the F-S fighting knife have a blade length that is about 7.5 in (19 cm). This weapon is one of the most effective melee weapons in existence, and a well executed thrust to the heart can make an enemy bleed out in about 2-5 seconds. \n \n%c[0,140,140,140]PROPERTIES: \n%c[0,153,255,255] • %c[0,140,140,140] usable for:%c[0,170,170,170] combat (very high damage) </text>

TRG-42 is a variant chambered in powerful .338 Lapua Magnum cartridge, which allows for accurate shooting on ranges well above 1500m. The TRG system is almost unique in being a purpose-designed sniper rifle, rather than an accurised version of an existing, general-purpose rifle. It uses standard SAKO bolt action, with rotating bolt having three massive lugs at the front. The heart of the TRG system is a cold-hammer forged receiver and barrel. Both provide maximum strength for minimum weight as well as excellent resistance to wear. The action has a hex style profile on top with a smaller closed ejection port. The bolt handle is the appropriate length and sports a large synthetic bulbous knob that provides a firm, positive grip. The receiver's large bedding surface is mated to an aluminium alloy-bedding block by three screws for maximum stability. This combination ensures an unusually high degree of stability. Free-floating, heavy, chrome moly barrels are used. Chrome moly barrels resist throat erosion better offering a longer accuracy life than stainless steel barrels. Two-stage match trigger, with very light pull weight (~1kg) can be adjusted for shooter's needs. The TRG stock design is besides sniping requirements, designed to conform to both UIT and CISM regulations. TRG rifles are popular among militaries, law enforcement agencies and civilian shooters and are by many considered one of the best sniper rifles currently available. TRG-42 rifles are used by special forces units from Finland, Norway, Switzerland and even Russia and Ukraine. In The Zone, TRG rifles are used by stalkers who brought them in or mercenaries. They are used to kill enemies in heavy body armor or to shoot dangerous mutants from long distances on which shooters themselves stay safe. \n \n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Reliability: %c[0,170,170,170]very high\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Durability: %c[0,170,170,170]very high\n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] Ergonomics: %c[0,170,170,170]above average %c[0,140,140,140] \n \n%c[0,93,0,116] • %c[0,140,140,140] ATTACHMENTS: 14x Leupold VX-3 4.5-14x40mm variable magnification scope (permanent), .338 caliber suppressor</text>

These rifles were manufactured with excellent quality, which together with it's modifications make it widely considered to be the one of the best AK variants ever made. The differences from Rk62 are new, side folding stock, enlarged trigger guard, which allows to shoot with thick gloves on (very important in harsh Finnish winter), a new handguard with three venting slots and ability to easily adjust gas system. An efficient muzzle device is installed, which reduces recoil, muzzle flash and allows shooting rifle grenades. Additionally it can use underbarrel rifle grenades. All the rest is the same as in Rk62 rifle. Mechanically, Rk62 is basically the same as AKM, but it has a lot of external changes to it, like different stock and handguard, precision sights installed and new muzzle device.

These rifles were manufactured with excellent quality, which together with it's modifications make it widely considered to be the one of the best AK variants ever made. Rk62 was a base for development another great AK variant with even higher reliability - the Israeli Galil. Rk62 was designed jointly by Valmet and Sako in 1962 using Polish AKM variant as base. Mechanically, Rk62 is basically the same as AKM, but it has a lot of external changes to it. It has redesigned, tubular stock, which is very durable. Rear sight was moved to rear of the receiver cover and front sight was moved on top of gas tube, which makes it harder to bend or damage. The change also made the sight line almost twice as long, which significantly improved practical accuracy. Another modification is a new, three-prong flash hider, similar to that on M16A1 rifles, which greatly reduces the muzzle flash.

Unlike the rifle variants, it has a unique 420 mm (16.5 in) barrel with six right-hand grooves at a 250 mm (1:9.8 in) rifling twist rate, ended with a recoil compensator, a slightly different charging handle and a magazine well conversion insert enabling the use of standard 25-round box magazines from the Steyr MPi 81 and TMP submachine guns. A conversion kit used to transform any assault rifle configuration into the submachine gun configuration is also available. The conversion kit consists of a barrel, bolt, adapter insert and magazine. The Steyr AUG Para also known as the AUG SMG or AUG 9mm is chambered in 9?19mm Parabellum cartridge and has been produced since 1988.[1] It differs from the A1 model by the barrel, bolt, magazine and a magazine well adapter, which allows the rifle to feed from Steyr MPi 69 magazines. This variant operates as a blowback firearm, without the use of the rifle's gas system.[16] For some time a kit of the above components was available to convert any AUG into a 9mm variant.

The MP-412 is a double action revolver with a break-open frame and simultaneous extraction. The bottom frame is a composite type – it consists of a steel basic frame and a polymer envelope, which forms the grip and trigger guard. Polymer grip/trigger guard unit can be removed from the steel frame if necessary. The trigger is a conventional type, double action/single action, with exposed hammer. The firing pin is mounted in the frame. The barrel/cylinder group latch is located at the top rear of the frame, and is operated by two buttons that must be pushed inwards to unlock the frame. The cylinder holds 6 rounds and has an automatic ejector that throws the cases out of the cylinder once the barrel is fully tipped down. If necessary, the automatic ejection feature can be manually switched off. Only about a hundred of these revolvers were manufactured, since US banned the import of Russian firearms, the IzhMash lost their primary market.

It went on to become the most famous assault rifle ever designed, serving in many countries with more than 100 million units made. Mechanically, it's a gas operated, selective fire assault rifle. The gas operated action has a massive bolt carrier with a permanently attached long stroke gas piston. The bolt carrier moves on the two rails with visible clearances between the parts, which allows the gun to operate even when it's interior is severely fouled with sand or mud. Overengineered receiver and chrome lined barrel provide exceptional durability, and the well-designed cartridge dimensions and strong action allow for reliable feeding in almost all conditions, even when the weapon is very dirty and/or corroded. Due to it's great balance of firepower, accuracy, reliability and low price, the AK-47 is often considered the "gold standard" and a point of reference among assault rifles. It is reliable, easy to produce, easy to operate and very effective. First AKs were produced in 1949, and until today, more than 100 million AKs of all kinds were manufactured, with AK-47 and it's variants making up about 75% of them.
